Ex: ['Under pressure from shoppers complaining about losing the ability to receive tips last month as the company looked to smooth out the earnings curve, Instacart said it is re-introducing customer tipping.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter announcing this change, we heard a lot of feedback from our shopper community,\xe2\x80\x9d the company said in a blog post. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile our shoppers liked most of the changes, they did not like the fact that we were removing tips from our online platform. Taking that feedback into account, we have decided to continue to accept tips as part of this change.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCEO Apoorva Mehta stressed that the decision came from customers looking to continue tipping, rather than complaints from shoppers, which he called a small group that was \xe2\x80\x9cvery vocal\xe2\x80\x9d about the change. However, following removing tips, Instacart received some backlash from shoppers who said they were losing significant portions of their earnings. The backlash went so far as to inspire a boycott among some shoppers, though again Mehta said that this was not the primary cause for returning tipping.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have tens of thousands of shoppers,\xe2\x80\x9d Mehta said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that a lot of times it\xe2\x80\x99s the most vocal ones you hear from.\xc2\xa0A lot of times what ends up happening is that frankly we were over-communicative, we communicated for weeks before the chain before it happened. Genuinely, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be the case that we can always do better, this is one of those cases where we can definitely\xc2\xa0do better. I hope the next time changes we carry out, we hope that we\xe2\x80\x99re better at it now than we were before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDespite all this, Mehta said the company was clearly communicating with the shopper base what the change would be. But he also said that Instacart, with the change, was \xe2\x80\x9cgetting in the way\xe2\x80\x9d of customers tipping their shoppers, which would have to then rely on cash in order to give a tip for a good customer experience. One original argument for the change was that 20% of customers didn\xe2\x80\x99t tip, but that other 80% comprised a significant portion of its shopper base\xe2\x80\x99s income.\nInstacart has to remain competitive among other on-demand services that are looking to scoop up the same potential shopper base. In that sense, Instacart has to ensure that it provides a positive shopper experience as well as a customer experience, and changing a long-accustomed to model can incite a lot of backlash. In this case, it appears that the shopper base was content with the old model, and it certainly seems like the model was working well for shoppers despite more chaotic income rates.\nAnd as Instacart continues to expand, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to not only rely on a good shopper experience and marketing, but also positive word of mouth from shoppers. If even a \xe2\x80\x9cvocal minority\xe2\x80\x9d ends up fighting back against changes, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to cause a potential optics issue for the company\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to attract new shoppers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we look at, from the shopper\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, there is a market-clearing wage that we have for shoppers,\xe2\x80\x9d Mehta said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we benchmark is with other on-demand services and other jobs that are similar. We need to make sure we are paying competitive to those. That\xe2\x80\x99s better than anyone else, this is a competitive market, if shoppers are not able to earn a competitive wage on Instacart\xc2\xa0they will defect to other platforms.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCustomers will still pay a service fee at checkout. \xe2\x80\x9cThis payment will be used to guarantee a higher commission to all shoppers,\xe2\x80\x9d the company said in a blog post. \xe2\x80\x9cShoppers will no longer need to depend on tips for the majority of their compensation.\xc2\xa0This also means that customers no longer need to feel obligated to tip. However, if a customer wishes to recognize exceptional service, they will have the ability to tip their shopper directly on the Instacart platform.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis update launches\xc2\xa0on October 17 in Washington D.C.,\xc2\xa0and the change comes to\xc2\xa0San Francisco and Instacart\xe2\x80\x99s other\xc2\xa0markets on October 24.\n'],
