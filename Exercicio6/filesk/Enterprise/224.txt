SkyGiraffe helps enterprises give their employees access to their line-of-business apps and enterprise data from virtually any device. The company today announced that it has raised a $6 million funding round led by SGVC, with participation from Trilogy Equity Partners and a number of angel investors, including Heroku founder and CEO James Lindenbaum, Lookout founder and CTO Kevin Mahaffey and Parse founder and CEO Ilya Sukhar.
SkyGiraffe does a couple of things. It helps businesses connect and aggregate data from their various on-premises and cloud-based applications and lets them build new apps or bring existing apps to iOS, Android and Windows. The company argues that its approach allows enterprises to bring their cross-platform development cycles down to a day, compared to the months it would take to develop custom apps for iOS and Android, for example.

The core of the service is the SkyGiraffe Integration server that can pull in data from most standard enterprise database systems, as well as applications like Salesforce and Workday. You then build your applications in the drag-and-drop interface of the SkyGiraffe Studio app and, depending on how you want to set up the system, you can then distribute those apps through a self-hosted distribution server behind your firewall, or use SkyGiraffe’s cloud services to distribute and manage the applications. SkyGiraffe also allows you to use its cloud services to integrate your data.
The kind of apps you would build with SkyGiraffe include standard line-of-business apps for your workflow (think managing time sheets or building an executive sales dashboard for the C-suite).
As the company also announced today, it now offers a REST endpoint that allows you to integrate third-party front-end applications like Slack, Office 365, Skype and Google Sheets. The code for this, including for SkyGiraffe’s Slack bot, is now available on GitHub. With this, developers now have a single API endpoint they can use to build on top of the company’s platform.
“Optimizing business processes in the mobile era depends on secure, scalable data access for applications,” said SkyGiraffe founder and CEO Boaz Hecht in today’s announcement. “SkyGiraffe’s platform provides customers with a competitive advantage in solving this issue to execute on their mobility strategies at unprecedented speed and scale.”
Today’s funding round brings SkyGiraffe’s total funding to $10.5 million. The company says it will use today’s funding round to “continue expanding the breadth and capabilities of its platform among other initiatives.”
