As expected, Microsoft released a new build of Windows 10’s technical preview today for users who are in the “Fast” update cycle for the company’s next operating system.
The build contains a few changes that users requested, including new animations for minimizing applications, and the ability to change what buttons appears on the Start bar.
On the new feature front, three-finger gesture support has been included that is similar to what OS X currently offers. Here’s Microsoft’s Gabe Aus descriptions of what now works:
My Windows 10 machine is at my house so I can’t test them out at the moment, but I can say that they are a welcome addition.

That’s merely to point out that touchpads on Windows machines have traditionally been lacking.
How about something like this, Microsoft? I’d probably buy one.
Also included in the build are improvements to Internet Explorer, native MKV support, user interface changes, and tweaks for OneDrive:
Again, I’ll need more time with the code, but the changes sound reasonable on paper.
The updates come from its own ideas, as well as those sourced from community feedback. User comment is being incorporated into the product, so keep it coming.
