That didn’t take long. Former Ford President CEO has found a new parking spot at Google after just retiring from Ford Motor Company earlier this month.
Google has just announced the appointment of Alan Mulally to its Board of Directors and will serve on Google’s Audit Committee. His appointment was effective July 9, 2014.
Mulally joins Google after serving two successful stints at Ford and Boeing. Mulally led Ford through the crisis that rocked the U.S. auto industry and propel the car company into the technology age. Mulally even made several appearances at the Consumer Electronics Show, including talking with us in 2011.
Mulally was also long considered to be on Microsoft’s short list to replace Steve Ballmer. Earlier this year, Mulally himself publicly announced that he was not going to take the job at Microsoft and would stay with Ford at least through 2014. Apparently his plans changed, as he retired from the car company on July 1.
“I am honored to serve on the board of a global iconic company that is dedicated to enhancing our lives,” Mulally said in a released statement. “I look forward to working together with the Google board and management team to continue to deliver their compelling vision.”
