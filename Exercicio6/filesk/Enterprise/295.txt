The spa industry is in need of a technology makeover and Zenoti thinks it can help. The Seattle-based startup is raising $15 million in a round led by Norwest Venture Partners to help salons run their businesses.
A cloud-based management platform, Zenoti helps spa chains with everything from billing to inventory management. They aim to create a tailored enterprise software experience for what they believe to be an under-served industry.
“Wellness enterprises need an integrated solution to support new business models like monthly subscriptions, online booking/payment and loyalty management,” said Mohan Kumar, executive director at NVP. “Zenoti has proven their solutions work for large chains in the US and Asia.”
Zenoti co-founder Dheeraj Koneru tells TechCrunch that the funding will be used to expand to new regions, including Europe.
He said the service also benefits consumers because they can now “book their appointments online or through the mobile app.”
While there are other software solutions for the beauty industry, the Zenoti team believes theirs is the most comprehensive.
Launched six years ago, Zenoti previously raised $6 million in a round led by Accel.
