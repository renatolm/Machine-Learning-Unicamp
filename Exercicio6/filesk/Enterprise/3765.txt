GoodData, a cloud-based big data analytics firm, is rising higher into the clouds itself. Today it is announcing a $25.7 million round of funding led by Intel Capital, with participation also from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, Tenaya Capital, TOTVS, Next World Capital, Windcrest, and Pharus Capital. This is a Series E round for the company, which has raised $101.2 million to date, and comes as the company is reportedly eyeing up an IPO in 2016.
The last round raised by GoodData was in June 2013, when it raised $22 million led by Brazil’s TOTVS.
Originally founded in the Czech Republic but now based in San Francisco, GoodData competes against a large swathe of other tech companies that are, like GoodData, capitalising on the shift that enterprises are making to cloud-based services and the boom in big data analytics that has come in the wake of our so much of our lives moving online. Others in the space include RJMetrics, Chartio, Business Objects, Domo and Tableau.
One of the differences between GoodData and the rest of the pack, according to Roman Stanek, GoodData‘s CEO, is in how it structures its analytics to cover a spectrum of uses, but in a way that is nontechnical and easy to integrate.
