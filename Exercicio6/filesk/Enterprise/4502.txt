Mitro, a company that helps corporate companies and SMBs manage shared passwords, has recently introduced a new extension of their platform called Mitro Access, which grants temporary access (with restrictions) to your various online accounts.
Here’s how it works:
Traditionally, Mitro is a mostly enterprise product that allows a company like, say, TechCrunch to store passwords for Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other back-end systems. Those stored passwords are entirely manageable in terms of who has access and what they can do. And if you have to let someone go, you can revoke individual access with a click of a button.
With Mitro Access, the same fundamentals now apply to more freelance workers. The product is currently in Alpha, and lets you give access to your eBay, Twitter, WordPress and OkCupid to anyone with a time limit and certain restrictions. For example, users can give a TaskRabbit the job of listing a bunch of eBay items, but with the link given, they won’t be able to bid on any items from your account.
In OkCupid, they can help you edit your profile but are not allowed to send a message. Early users have also discovered that with Mitro Access, people given access to Twitter can sign into multiple accounts from one browser, making it easy for corporate social media managers to control various accounts at once.
The idea here is that Mitro Access is a more accessible product for individuals as opposed to businesses, though both types of customer will likely enjoy the benefits. This expands Mitro’s footprint as a company beyond big companies who require this type of product.
For now, Mitro Access is free to try, and Mitro itself is also based around a freemium model, where companies can pay extra for special features like audit logs and Google Groups synchronization.
