Airpost, a startup that helps IT managers monitor their employees’ cloud applications, announced this morning that it has been acquired by Box.
Airpost founder and CEO Navid Nathoo’s blog post makes this sound like a talent acquisition. The Airpost team will be joining Box (which went public just under a month ago), while the Airpost service will be shut down on March 1.
A Box spokesperson confirmed the news via email.
Here’s how Nathoo explains the deal:
I haven’t been able to find much press coverage of Airpost on TechCrunch or elsewhere, but Nathoo writes that the company was founded two years ago. (It was incubated at the enterprise-focused Alchemist Accelerator.) The goal was to help IT managers make peace with the cloud by giving them “the visibility and confidence they needed to securely adopt and deploy cloud applications into their organization.”
