GuideSpark, a Menlo Park-based startup that provides employers with customizable video templates for conveying what would normally be incredibly boring HR paperwork, is rolling out a new platform for smoothly delivering its content on phones and tablets.
In addition to enabling access to bite-sized explainer videos on topics like benefits and compensation to almost any mobile device, the new HTML5-powered platform lets employers integrate surveys and quizzes to help reinforce the information they’re trying to get across.
And to make sure that employees are taking advantage of their HR videos, GuideSpark has included a more complete set of self-serve analytics tools so that its clients can verify that their money is being put to good use.

“Our new platform, built on five years of knowledge gathering and refinement based on existing customer experiences, is a stellar example of our commitment to always deliver the most innovative and effective solutions for employee engagement and communications,” GuideSpark CEO Keith Kitani wrote to me in an email. “We are proud to introduce this new platform to the world, and are confident that it will drive measurable benefits for all of our customers.”
Back in March, GuideSpark announced that it had raised $15 million in a Series B from NEA, as well as existing investors Storm Ventures and IDG Ventures. Since then, the company has added PepsiCo to its client list, which already included News Corp, Dropbox, and Adobe, and achieved 1 million employees served across its client companies, a figure that has grown by more than 300 percent since the beginning of 2013.
