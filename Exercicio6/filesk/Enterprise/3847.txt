Microsoft has announced two coming board departures, two board additions, and a boost to its dividend.
Leaving the board are Dave Marquardt and Dina Dublon. Marquardt is best known for his work in venture capital, and Dublon for her work at JPMorgan Chase. Taking their places are the appointed Teri List-Stoll from Kraft and Charles Scharf of Visa.
I doubt there will be serious opposition to the board changes. If you’re a Microsoft shareholder, it’s time to start doing your homework on what the new blood might bring the software company.
Microsoft also announced that its dividend will be increased by 11 percent, or $0.03 to a total of $0.31 per share, per quarter. Before the increase, Microsoft’s stock had a yearly yield of 2.4 percent.
Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer recently stepped down from Microsoft’s board.
