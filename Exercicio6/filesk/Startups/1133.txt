A San Francisco judge has sentenced former RadiumOne and Gravity4 CEO Gurbaksh Chahal to 12 months in county jail.
However, the judge also granted a stay on the sentence pending an appeal from Chahal’s lawyer, according to Bloomberg’s Ellen Huet.

The initial guilty plea resulted in intense public criticism of adtech company RadiumOne, which then pushed Chahal out of his role as CEO.
He started a new company, Gravity4, where he was recently replaced as CEO by his sister, Kamal Kaur.
