TechCrunch is finally in Tel Aviv, and we can’t be more excited to be here. And it seems like the folks here in Israel are pretty excited about it, too.
We’ve entirely sold out of tickets for the TC Meetup + Pitch-off, going down on Wednesday evening at 5:30pm.
However, if you want to attend the event and don’t yet have a ticket, we encourage you to join the Wait List for the Meetup right here.
If you want a more surefire entry into the event, there is one other way to get in. Startups that are less than two years old and have less than $2.5 million in funding can buy a startup demo table for 3,868 ILS.
You can hit up the link here to buy a demo table.
Some extra information about the event:

You can find the full agenda for the event, including the world-renowned pitch-off (hosted by me), right here.
