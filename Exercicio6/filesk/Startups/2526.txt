It’s time. The TC Pitch-offs are just a couple short weeks away, and applications for the competition close on Friday.
That means you have only two days to get in on the action.
Ten companies will be given 60 seconds to pitch their wares to a panel of judges, including TC editors and local VCs. The judges, along with the audience, will help determine three winners.
First place gets a table in Startup Alley at the upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt SF. Second place wins two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner gets one ticket to the show.
Any entrepreneur looking to make some new connections with the local tech scene or pick up some new users should definitely throw their hat in the ring.
Apply here.
But even if you’re not going to get on stage, we still hope to see you at the event.
