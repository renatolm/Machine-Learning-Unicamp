Ain’t no party like a Netflix party cause a Netflix party eventually stops after a weekend of bingeing on House Of Cards and doesn’t start again until Netflix releases the new season the next year.
But now there’s Netflix Party, a chrome extension that lets viewers sync their Netflix viewing session across time and space and adds a group chat sidebar for good measure. Remember Xbox Live’s Netflix Party? Yeah, it’s like that but in a browser window.
This extension is not from Netflix so install at your own risk.
Netflix Party is easy enough to install. Download the plug-in and start watching a video on Netflix. The plug-in then becomes active and creates a sharable link. It’s that easy. Now you don’t have to cry alone when watching Where The Red Fern Grows.
