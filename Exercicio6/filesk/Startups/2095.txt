Tonight is the night!
After about a week of meeting as many Israeli startups and VCs as possible, it’s time to really get down to business at the TC Meetup + Pitch-off in Tel Aviv.
If you don’t already have a ticket, I’m very sorry to say that we are completely sold out. In fact, we even had to close the waitlist. In other words, ticket-holders need to show up as promptly as possible.
We also have a few important reminders about location, schedule, etc. for folks planning to attend the event:
