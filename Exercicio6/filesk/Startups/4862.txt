Don’t ever say we aren’t flexible. You needed a few extra days to commit to clicking the buy button on tickets to Disrupt NY 2016, and we’re happy to give that to you. 
We’re extending the deadline on our extra early-bird tickets to next Wednesday, February 24, so you have a few extra days to save $200 before early-bird pricing takes effect next week. This is the only extension we’ll be giving, however, so be sure to visit our ticketing page on or before the 24th to get your Disrupt tickets at the lowest possible price point.
Besides saving you some hard-earned cash, your extra early-bird Disrupt ticket gets you into all the interviews and fireside chats with the incredible lineup of entrepreneurs, investors and innovators we are lining up for this year’s show, and lets you check out all the amazing startups competing for the coveted Disrupt Cup and $50,000 grand prize in the Startup Battlefield.
Plus, you’ll be able to chat with the dozens of companies on display in Startup Alley, and attend all of the parties and after-parties to keep the conversation and networking going long after the show floor closes for the day.
Disrupt NY 2016 runs from May 9-11 at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in New York City, and you’re definitely going to want to be there. But you’ll need a ticket to get in the door, and you have just a few days left to grab a ticket and save a few hundred bucks in the process.
To score your extra early-bird tickets to Disrupt, just head on over to our ticketing page and buy a ticket or two before the 24th.
We can’t wait to see you at the show!
