Less than a month after Lyft launched scheduled trips, Uber is doing the same thing starting today with the worldwide roll-out of Scheduled Rides. Now, you can schedule your car from 30 minutes up to 30 days in advance — but only for uberX. Lyft, on the other hand, only lets you schedule rides up to 24 hours in advance. I personally don’t see when I would ever schedule a ride 30 days ahead of time, but, whatever. This is clearly not about me.
Uber will send you reminders, one 24 hours and another 30 minutes ahead of your scheduled ride. Once your driver is on their way, you’ll receive a notification as well as information about whether surge pricing will be applied to your trip.
Uber’s starting the scheduled rides roll-out in Seattle, “followed by other top business travel cities,” according to the company’s blog post. Riders with business profiles or people who have their profiles linked to their employer’s Uber for Business account get priority access for scheduled trips. Uber says scheduled rides has been a top-requested feature from business riders. You can see how it works below.
