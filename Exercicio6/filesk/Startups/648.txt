Seattle-based Rover is in the process of closing a $40 million round of funding, according to sources with knowledge of the deal.
The Series E round would value Rover at nearly $300 million, and it comes from existing investors Menlo Ventures, Madrona Venture Group and Foundry Group. The company had previously raised more than $50 million.
When we reached out to Rover for comment, a spokesperson responded, “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation.”


The company has also said that it has reached an annual revenue run rate of $100 million in gross billings, with its network of sitters growing 50 percent to 65,000. (At the beginning of this year, competitor DogVacay said it had 25,000 sitters.)
