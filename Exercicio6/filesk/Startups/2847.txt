You saw it coming, right? 3D model repository Sketchfab just added support for all major virtual reality headsets out there. You can now view your pretty 3D models in your VR headset.
The Sketchfab VR apps work with the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Gear VR and Cardboard. The startup already announced support for Google Cardboard back in January thanks to WebVR. But now that other (more powerful) headsets are out, it’s good to see expanded support with native apps.
Sketchfab is all about viewing 3D models. Think about it as a sort of YouTube or SoundCloud for 3D files. So it makes perfect sense that you’d want to move around 3D models with a VR headsets. It’s much more immersive than having to drag your mouse or finger around the screen.
Right now, the Sketchfab app supports a selection of 3D models as a demonstration. But the plan is to expand to Sketchfab’s entire library of 3D models. The startup now hosts 750,000 3D models.
If you really can’t wait and want to see a specific Sketchfab 3D model in your VR headset, you can point your browser to a Sketchfab page and press the VR button. This WebVR viewer isn’t as good as a native app, but it’s a good intermediary step.
With today’s news, it’s clear that Sketchfab is well-positioned to make it less cumbersome to view 3D models in a VR headset. For example, if you’re a 3D artist working on characters and objects for a VR video game, you could see how they would look without relying on a game engine.
As for VR enthusiasts, Sketchfab could be a great app to show your friends what you can do with VR. In many ways, wearing a VR headset feels like teleportation. And Sketchfab’s VR capabilities are a good example of that.
