So, why should you compete in the Startup Battlefield? For starters, you’ll get to pitch your company to some of the best and brightest entrepreneurs and investors in the world who will give you incredible feedback on how to make your product or service even better.
Plus, all Battlefield companies receive pitch coaching from TechCrunch to help them perfect their pitches for our judges. Plus, each company selected to the Battlefield will get a free booth in the Battlefield section of Startup Alley so they can network with folks on the show floor, as well as the opportunity to network with speakers and judges at our VIP events. 
And if that isn’t enough awesome stuff to encourage you to apply, the winner of the Startup Battlefield receives $50,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.
Since 2007, the 543 Battlefield companies have raised over $5.7 billion after appearing on the TechCrunch stage, and 69 have exited. The Battlefield has helped launch companies like Zenefits, which raised a $500 million Series C round in May 2015, and Fitbit, which spiked more than 50 percent in its IPO debut in 2015.
