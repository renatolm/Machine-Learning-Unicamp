I’ll be in Chicago this week and I’d love to meet some startups. I’m thinking about holding a micro-mini-meetup on Tuesday, July 26 at a location to be determined. Here’s what I need from you all:
Email or tweet me with recommendations where we can meet. I like to just hang out in bars but I could do a co-working space. I know there are a few in town but I’ve lost touch with folks there so it would be great if you could drop me a line. My email is john@techcrunch.com and I’m @johnbiggs on TwooterTalk.
I expect we’d meet at about 7pm and I’d be happy to run a pitch-off. If you’d like to pitch just fill this out and I’ll let you know the details when I have them.
