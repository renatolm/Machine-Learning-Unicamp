Curioos has experimented with other formats in the past, but its core product hasn’t changed much over the past few years. The New York-based startup sells art prints from digital artists. And it’s a great way to decorate your home or office. Curioos is now taking things a step further with two additional formats.
These new formats aren’t a gigantic departure as they’ll still let you hang art on your wall. But they look and feel different as they’re made out of aluminum. Let’s start with the simple one.
First, you can now order disk prints on aluminum. As the name suggests, these are circular artworks without any frames or anything. Thousands of prints are available in this format.
But the other (and more interesting) format is the custom-shaped die-cut aluminum prints. These will look great on non-white walls as they’ll stand out. These are a bit harder to make as you need to have a single object of focus that you can cut out from the background. So it doesn’t make sense for any kind of art.
Some items already look great using this format. Artists can get creative, and it opens up a lot of decoration possibilities. It looks like most of these items cost around $99.
Like other Curioos products, artists get a cut on every sale. Curioos recently opened the doors of its marketplace, allowing anyone to submit wall art and choose formats. Curioos curators still have to approve the uploaded images before they go live on the website, but the startup tries to make this process as frictionless as possible.
