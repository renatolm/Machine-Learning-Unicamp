Fresh on the heels of Disrupt NY, weâ€™re packing up and heading to Austin and Seattle for the TC Meetup + Pitch-off.
Ten companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch to a panel of expert judges, including local VCs and TC editors, as well as our lovely audience.
Judges will conduct a quick Q&A on stage, and at the end of all the presentations, they will determine our winners. First place gets a table in Startup Alley at TC Disrupt San Francisco. Second place gets two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner gets one ticket to the big show.
It all goes down on June 14 (Austin) and June 16 (Seattle), at 6pm.
You can get details on event location and tickets here for Austin and here for Seattle. (21+ only, please.)
If you want to apply to the pitch-off, hit up the application link here. Applications close June 3.
We look forward to seeing you at the event!
