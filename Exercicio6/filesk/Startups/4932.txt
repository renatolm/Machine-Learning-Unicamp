The Boston and Atlanta Meetups are but a week away, and we have finally confirmed the companies pitching in the Pitch-Offs.
These startups will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product to a panel of expert VC judges, and after each presentation they will be subject to a quick Q&A. At the end of all the pitches, the judges will determine the winners.
First place gets a table in Startup Alley at TC Disrupt NY in May. Second place gets two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice Winner will get one ticket.
Applications are sadly closed, but tickets are still available to the meetups. We simply ask that you are 21 years of age or older.
Buy tickets to the Boston Meetup on February 23 here. 
Buy tickets to the Atlanta Meetup on February 25 here. 
And without any further ado, here are the finalists for the Pitch-Offs:
See you folks soon!
