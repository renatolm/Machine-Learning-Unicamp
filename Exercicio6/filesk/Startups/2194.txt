Dear Seattle,
We’ve arrived. We have our pitch-off companies in a row, and our judges are locked and loaded.
All we need now is you.
We’ll be hanging out at the ShowBox SoDo from 6pm to 10pm. Ten companies will have exactly 60 seconds to pitch their products on stage, and one will eventually be crowned the winner.
Plus, there will be plenty of time to drink alcohol and network with fellow tech enthusiasts from the area.
Sounds fun, right?
Buy tickets to the event right here. 
Can’t wait to see you there!
