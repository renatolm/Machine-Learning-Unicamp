Anyong Haseyo!
TechCrunch is South Korea-bound and we’re going to do some Seoul searching for the greatest tech in the East. We’re bringing the legendary TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off to Seoul on October 27, but when we get down to the heart of it, the event starts now.
We’re looking for ten incredible South Korean startups to present their wares on stage at the event, to both the audience and a panel of expert judges. Judges will include local VCs and big-time executives, and the winner will walk away with a table in the next Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt.
Applications open TODAY and you can get started on your application right here.
But this isn’t just about startups pitching on stage. The whole purpose of TechCrunch events is to get time with the local tech communities around the globe.
We want to hear what you’re working on, and we can’t wait to meet you in person.
