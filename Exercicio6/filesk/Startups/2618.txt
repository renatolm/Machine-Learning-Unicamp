While we put the figurative closed sign on Disrupt NY just a few weeks ago, it’s never too early to start thinking about what’s next. Disrupt SF is still a few months away, but today we’re excited to announce that tickets to display in Startup and Hardware Alley at Disrupt are now available to purchase.
Tickets to display in the Alley start at $1,995, which gets your company two tickets to Disrupt SF, including one day to pitch your company to the thousands of attendees who’ll be walking the show floor. You can bring up to three additional members of your startup for just an additional $997.50 apiece.
On the days you’re not in the Alley, you can check out all the interviews and fireside chats with some of the best and brightest inventors, investors and entrepreneurs in the industry, watch the companies competing in the illustrious Startup Battlefield competition, and even check out some of the competition in Startup and Hardware Alley.
In fact, your company might even get selected to participate in the Startup Battlefield. Each day of Startup Alley, conference attendees vote for their favorite Startup Alley company of the day, and the startup that gets a combination of the most attendee and editorial votes gets an entry into the Battlefield.
To display in Startup Alley, companies must be less than two years old and have secured less than $2 million in funding. But as long as you meet those requirements, you can head on over to our ticketing page to get your Startup Alley tickets to Disrupt SF here.
Disrupt SF takes place September 12-14 at Pier 48, and we can’t wait to see you and your awesome startup in the Alley.
