TechCrunch Include Office Hours are happening on June 16th! Pejman Nozad, Mar Hershenson, Ajay Kamat and Neda Blocho from Pejman Mar Ventures, along with Adam Plotkin from ffVC, will join TechCrunch to provide valuable advice and feedback to startups.
Launched in 2014, Include is TechCrunch’s diversity program, aimed at facilitating opportunities for underrepresented groups in tech to take their startups to the next level.
The Office Hours program is part of that effort. Once monthly, TechCrunch works with VC partners to provide feedback and advice to early-stage companies. To be considered for a meeting in our June session with Pejman Mar in San Francisco or ffVC in New York City, fill out the application here by Friday, June 10th at 9am PT.
Underrepresented groups in tech include, but are not limited to, Black, Latino, Native American, LGBT and female founders. Preference will be given to teams that can meet in person. Startups should at least be at the prototype stage.
Let’s learn more about our co-hosts.
If you’re interested in attending Office Hours with Pejman Mar or ffVC, apply here by Friday June 10th.
