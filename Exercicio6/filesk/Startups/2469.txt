This is your last chance.
At the end of the day, applications will close for the TC Pitch-offs, going down in Austin and Seattle in a couple of weeks. And I don’t want you to miss out.
We’ve already gotten dozens of applicants for both Austin (June 14) and Seattle (June 16), but in the end, only ten companies will compete. Each will be given exactly 60 seconds to pitch their wares to a panel of expert judges, including TC editors and local VCs.
First place will receive a table in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt SF, where they’ll have the chance to pitch to VCs and press attendees. Second place gets two tickets to the show, and the Audience Choice winner gets one ticket to the conference.
If you’re even remotely interested in this opportunity, you have a few hours left.
Apply here.
If you aren’t into the idea of hopping on stage, we still want to see you there.
Buy tickets to the Austin meetup on June 14 at 6pm right here.
Buy tickets to the Seattle meetup on June 16 at 6pm right here. 
Can’t wait to see you there!
