Apple has issued a statement tonight that is essentially setting expectations for those who hoped they’d be able to walk into an Apple store on Friday and pick themselves up an iPhone. The statement makes it clear that all iPhones will be in short supply for walk-in customers without a reservation.
The statement also indicates that Apple’s jet black iPhones and all iPhone 7 plus models in all colors have sold out completely in the initial online ordering period and that no inventory will be available.
Yep, that’s right, if you want an iPhone in jet black, just order it online and wait — you won’t find one in stores.
This matches what I’ve heard, which is that jet black iPhone 7s are incredibly hard to come by — even for employees and executives inside Apple — especially the Plus models. Most reviewers and other early birds got matte black iPhone 7 Pluses to test — I only know of one exception.
I personally love the jet black finish and, regardless of a tendency to scuff, am really attached to it on my review iPhone 7. I’ll be waiting to buy a jet black Plus.
