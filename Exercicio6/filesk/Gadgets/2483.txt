Apple is holding Apple Spring Event 2016 today in Cupertino, and the company is planning once again to live stream the event. At 10 AM PT (1 PM ET, 5 PM GMT, 6 PM CET), you’ll be able to watch the event on all Apple devices.
If you have a new Apple TV, you can download the Apple Events app in the App Store. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old events. Users with old Apple TVs can simply turn on their devices. Apple is pushing out the “Apple Events” channel so that you can watch the event.
And if you don’t have an Apple TV, the company also lets you live stream the event from the Apple Events section on its website. This video feed only works in Safari and Microsoft Edge; the good news is that it works on OS X, iOS and Windows 10 — chances are you have at least one device running Safari or Edge.
So to recap, here’s how you can watch today’s Apple event:
