More and more Americans are buying into the Apple smartphone ecosystem, largely at the expense of Samsung.
A new report from the digital media analytics company comScore suggests that Apple’s iPhone is continuing to further its lead in the U.S. smartphone market, now accounting for 44.2 percent of all American smartphone users, an increase from the 43.1 percent share it held in April of this year.
A further breakdown shows Apple taking its bite largely out of Samsung’s piece of the pie. Samsung trails Apple with 27.3 percent, while the back of the pack is headed by LG, Motorola and HTC with 8.7 percent, 4.9 percent and 3.5 percent shares of the market, respectively.
Though Apple leads by devices, the Android operating system still reigns supreme with 51.4 percent of U.S. smartphone users on the platform.
