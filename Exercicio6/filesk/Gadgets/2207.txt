Longtime Apple industrial designer Danny Coster is joining GoPro. Coster had worked at Apple since the early 1990s, and helped Apple re-establish itself after Steve Jobs returned. Now he has to do that to GoPro. GoPro’s stock popped on the news and is trading up on the day.
The news comes from The Information and an internal email sent from GoPro’s founder and CEO, Nick Woodman.
“Ironically, Danny and I first met in December, 2001, on the beach in Sayulita, Mexico at the very start of the five month surfing trip where I developed and tested the first GoPro prototype,” said Woodman in a released statement. “His design pedigree speaks for itself, but I will say that we feel energized to have him join GoPro.”
GoPro has had rocky year and news of Danny Coster joining the company caused its stock to jump to its highest level since the middle of January. As of this post’s writing, the stock price is up 16% on the day.
Coster will report to Nick Woodman and official join the team at the end of April.
