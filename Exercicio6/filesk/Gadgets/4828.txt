Today at the Apple event we went hands-on with the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The new devices feature an additional layer of sensors that makes them able to detect varying levels of pressure from fingers on the screen. This enables new interactions both on the home screen and inside apps, both native and third party. The new phones also feature 12 megapixel cameras capable of shooting 4k video and a new front-facing ‘flash’ that uses the phone’s screen to fill out color at night for selfie shots.
We took a few of the new features for a spin in the video below.
