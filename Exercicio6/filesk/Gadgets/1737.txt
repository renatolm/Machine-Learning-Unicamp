Jabra’s been making moves over the past several years in an attempt to shake up its image as solely an office headset manufacturer. Of course, the Copenhagen-based technology company is still very much in the business of producing devices for call centers and the like, but these days it seems to prefer leading with products like the Wireless Sports Earbuds.
The new Jabra Halo Smart are, perhaps, the headset version of business casual. They’re wireless Bluetooth headphones first, featuring call functionality to “support the many scenarios of a busy lifestyle.”

The headphones’ most aesthetically interesting feature is the neckband that tethers them together. When a call comes in, the neckband vibrates, at which point users can answer by separating the magnetically attached earbuds as they hang around their neck.
Jabra’s vision revolves around users passively wearing the Halo Smart atop their shoulders, even when not listening to music or talking on the phone. And the estimated 17 hours of talk time (or 15 hours of music) should get people through a couple of days with no charging.
The headphones are hitting Best Buy for $80 this month.
