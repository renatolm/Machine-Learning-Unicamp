Microsoft has a new Xbox One to showcase at E3 later today, and here’s what it’s going to look like. Rumors of a slimmer, cheaper Xbox One have been quite persistent for the past few weeks. And the NeoGAF forums leaked two images and a small description of the new console. So meet the Xbox One S.
As expected, the Xbox One S is 40 percent slimmer than its predecessor. It comes with a 2TB hard drive, and the Blu-ray player is still there.
Here’s what we didn’t expect: the Xbox One S is compatible with 4K TVs and supports High Dynamic Range. Don’t expect to play games at a 4K resolution as the console isn’t more powerful than the existing Xbox One. But get ready for House of Cards in 4K.
The new Xbox is now white and you can optionally put it on a vertical stand if that’s your thing. NeoGAF user Ekim also says that the power brick is built into the Xbox One (like the PlayStation 4). It could make the overall package much smaller.
Interestingly, the pre-order page leak also says that the controller has been “streamlined.” From this picture, I can’t spot any difference with the existing Xbox One controller, except that it’s white. Microsoft already released an updated Xbox One controller with a built-in microphone jack port, as well as the Xbox One Elite controller.
Overall, these leaks seem likely. We’ll have to wait 9:30 AM Los Angeles time for the E3 conference with the official announcement with a release date and a price.
Rumor has it that Microsoft is also working on a much more powerful Xbox One. But the company plans to release this other model next year.
