“Fresh air” is a concept most often associated with the “great outdoors”. Dyson is looking to make your home nature fresh by ridding it of indoor pollutants with the Pure Cool Link purifier fan.
Hopefully, the engineering that went into James Dyson’s new gadget is better than the branding.
The company’s proposed ingenuity is that the Pure Cool Link is a smart device, equipped with a 360° Glass HEPA filter, with connectivity via the Dyson Link app for iOS or Android.
Users will be able to monitor interior and exterior air quality (via BreezoMeter data), while also adjusting the settings on the fan or keeping history on the environment.
For those who lead busy lives (or just aren’t into constantly monitoring air quality), the Pure Cool Link also has an auto mode available, which activates the purifier at different times in order to combat fluctuating oxygen quality. Dyson also claims their purifier removes 99.97% of pollutants and allergens from the air — we would definitely need to test that.
The bladeless fan and air purifier goes on sale today via direct and partner retailers for $499; indeed, clean interior air can now be considered the by-product of (working) technology.
It’s worth noting that similar offerings from competitors are considerably less expensive, like Coway’s air purifier ($250), and is even vouched for by a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist. So, there is that to consider.
