Do you like Nintendo? Do you have $19,000? I think we found you a watch. The Romain Jerome Super Mario Bros. the watchmaker’s take on good old Mario and his mushroom-induced adventures and is aimed at collectors who aren’t afraid to drop twenty grand on nostalgia.
The watch is RJ’s third arcade-themed piece and joins his Pac Man watch as well as his Space Invaders piece. The watch has an automatic movement but the real work went into the face which features a 3D playing field and enameled figures including a mushroom, a cloud, a bush, and finally a mightily-jumping Mario. The case is 46mm wide and the watch is limited to 85 pieces in honor of the game’s launch in 1985.
Obviously you’re not going to drop $20K on this thing (right?) but it’s a fun piece from one of the manufacturers who are actually tying to do something a little different in the luxury oeuvre. Plus Mario looks great up close.
