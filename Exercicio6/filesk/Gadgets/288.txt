Higher resolution is making for larger video and images, but luckily, flash memory capacity seems to be keeping pace. A new SDXC card from SanDisk unveiled today has 1TB of space available, which basically means you can put it in a camera and essentially forget it even has a storage cap at all.
The new 1TB capacity is just a prototype for now, meaning there’s not pricing or availability date yet, but the company has launched a 512GB version for $800, so it’s likely to be expensive whenever it does land. But you also get more storage space than typically ships with the base configuration of most home computers, so premium pricing is to be expected.
My own 5K iMac only has 256GB of storage, so I really don’t know how to feel about this. I do know that it took me around three years to fill a 256GB SD card with my Canon 6D shooting our Disrupt events, product reviews and more, so using that as a baseline this should last you basically to the end of your natural life even with terrible data management practices.
