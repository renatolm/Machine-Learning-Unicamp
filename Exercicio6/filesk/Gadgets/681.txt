Xiaomi’s numbers have been slipping some of late in its native China, but the company’s still announcing handsets at a healthy clip. A month after debuting the Redmi Pro, a high-end take on its budget line, the company is eyeing a rock bottom price point with its latest offering.
With a starting price of 899 yuan ($135), the Redmi Note 4 still manages to offer some key upgrades over its popular predecessor. Along with a new snazzed up new unibody design, the 5.5-inch handset features a deca-core Helios X20 processor from MediaTek and an impressively large 4100mAh battery, a bump from the Note 3’s already healthy 4000mAh.
The phone runs the MIUI 8, the latest version of Xiaomi’s custom Android-based operating system and ships with either 16GB or 64GB of storage, which is expandable up to 128GB, thanks to a microSD slot. On the back is a fingerprint sensor and a 13-megapixel camera (downgraded from 16, interestingly enough).
It’s on-sale in China starting tomorrow. More markets will be getting the budget handset soon, and hey, maybe we’ll even see it in the U.S. some day. Perhaps.
