It’s time to see what Samsung has been cooking up for the past year. After weeks of speculation, Samsung is taking over the CCIB in Barcelona right in time for Mobile World Congress. This year’s Unpacked conference is a big deal. The company wants to make a splash and make Samsung great again. Samsung has plenty of competition when it comes to Android devices with many brands undercutting the company, but Samsung is also the only one pushing the virtual reality angle so much.
The event starts at 7 PM CET (6 PM GMT, 1 PM EST, 10 AM PST) and TechCrunch’s Frederic Lardinois and Romain Dillet will be there bringing back the up-to-the-second news. We should go live at least a half an hour before the event starts to bring back photos and commentary from the scene — so be sure to join us early!
