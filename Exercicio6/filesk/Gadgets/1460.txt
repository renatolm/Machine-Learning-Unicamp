Here’s a neat little add-on for folks looking to get a little more out of their GoPro. The Vitrima is a big metal add-on created by Chicago-based startup Fantem that brings 3D video capture to the action camera.
The device features a plastic GoPro case affixed to a big lens with mirrors that split light, creating separate images for the left and right eyes. Two stereoscopic videos are combined into one that can be viewed through a VR headset like Google Cardboard, adding a sense of depth to the proceedings.
I tried out a couple of videos shot by different action sports videographers, and the effects were pretty impressive. Not the best 3D video I’ve seen by any stretch of the imagination, but still, pretty good for a low-cost camera add on. You can check out some of the footage (snowboarding, skydiving and the like) yourself on the company’s YouTube page, if you have a headset handy.

Fantem is currently offering up lenses for pre-order through Indiegogo. The lens kit will retail for $129. It’s set to start shipping next month.
