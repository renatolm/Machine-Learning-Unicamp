Incipio just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Shortly after after announcing that it had acquired up budget headphone maker Skullcandy, the Irvine-based accessories conglomerate has picked up Griffin for an undisclosed amount. The Nashville mobile peripheral manufacturer will join an sizable brand portfolio that already includes Incase, Braven, ClamCase and Incipio’s own titular in-house brand.
The latest score in Incipio’s supermarket sweep of mobile brands brings Griffin into the fold, but will maintain the standalone brand, including its headquarters, which will stay put in Tennessee. Griffin has been in the accessory game for a quarter decade, primarily making a name for itself in the world of Apple devices, including, perhaps most notably, the iTrip, an in-car FM transmitter for the iPod.
Two days ago, Incipio announced an amendment to a deal announced in June that would find the company picking up budget headphone maker Skullcandy, following the Incase deal, which went down last September. What does all of this mean for the rapidly growing hardware companies? Why, exciting new verticals, of course!
Here’s Incipio founder and CEO Andy Fathollahi in today’s official announcement, “As part of Incipio Group, Griffin strengthens our product development and manufacturing capabilities, complements our existing product lines in rugged cases, power and connectivity, and allows our brands to reach a broader domestic and international audience through enhanced distribution in the business-to-business, enterprise and education verticals.”
Verticals!
