While the Apple press conference is supposed to start in 30 minutes, it looks like it’s amateur hour or epic fail time at Amazon as the company just released a special page listing all iPhone 7 accessories, as Gizmodo first noticed. As you can see, it looks exactly like what we saw in previous leaks, with a single-camera model and a double-lens camera system for the iPhone 7 Plus.
Edit: Apple introduced the iPhone 7… on Twitter
Rumor has it that Apple is going to introduce the iPhone 7 with a much improved camera and a better flash. It should have streamlined antenna lines and a faster processor. And yet, the 3.5mm headphone port is going away. In fact, Amazon is already telling you to buy Bluetooth headphones on these product pages.
It’s unclear whether Amazon got a sneak peak of the new iPhone 7 or if the company made some assumptions and put these pages together in case the leaks are right. Of course, accessory makers need to start working on cases well in advance so that they’re ready when the new iPhone launches. But Amazon isn’t supposed to put up these product pages before the press conference.
Either way, we’ll find out soon enough if the iPhone 7 looks like this indeed. Here’s everything we expect Apple will announce during its press conference. And don’t forget to read the liveblog.
Here are a couple of screenshots of the pages in question before Amazon takes them down:
