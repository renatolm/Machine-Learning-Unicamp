With the holiday season in full swing, we’re looking forward to everything CES has to offer in the new year. But we’re also prepping for more gift-giving, following along with the TechCrunch Holiday Gift Guide. And because we can’t help ourselves, there is also a bit of Star Wars discussion there at the end. 
This week’s episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast is brought to you by John Biggs, Matt Burns, and Jordan Crook.
We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here.
