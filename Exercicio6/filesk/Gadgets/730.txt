Something meets boy, and something meets girl and they both look the same and they’re overjoyed in this world. But how much more overjoyed would they be if they could on a Skeletonized Androgyne Royale from Manufacture Royale? This wild watch costs a mere $61,000 and might be good for your father but not for your dad.
What is this monster, exactly? Basically it is a “steampunk-inspired” watch made of stainless steel, some polished by hand by a master craftsman and other parts PVD coated for maximum pop. The watch itself is completely hand-made and has a flying tourbillon, basically a system for spinning the balance wheel in a complete circle every minute in order to reduce the effects of gravity on the movement.
The Androgyne is also skeletonize which means all extraneous features have been removed including the face. Twelve screws mark the hours around the ring and Manufacture Royale uses a silicon escape wheel and ceramic bearings to ensure smooth motion without much lubricant, a high-tech addition to an already robotic-looking watch. The coolest feature is the fairly unique shape-changing case with articulated lugs that will surround your wrist for maximum “wearability.”
Interestingly, the Voltaire founded Manufacture Royale, a watch factory in 1770 and the brand survived his death in 1791. The company faded in the 1800s and was all but dead until a group of watchmakers and investors revived it in 2010. The watches are quite unique and bold and the unique case ensures a comfortable fit for both men and women.
While this watch won’t be able to tell the time in Cupertino (unless you set it to Cupertino time), rest assured that you’ll be wearing a one-of-a-kind, akin to strapping a Bugatti to your wrist. $61K too rich for your blood? Wait for your next exit. After all, tomorrow who’s going to fuss?
