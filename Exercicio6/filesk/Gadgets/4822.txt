In case you missed it, which would actually be quite difficult, Apple had a press event this week. The company unveiled new Apple Watch wristbands, a new Apple TV and remote, the iPad Pro (which is massive), the Apple Pencil (lol) and two new generations of the iPhone. 
Suffice it to say, it’s been a long week, even with Labor Day Monday. 
We discuss all this and more on this week’s episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast, featuring John Biggs, Greg Kumparak, and Jordan Crook.
We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here.
