The console war is back for a new holiday season. Microsoft and Sony both announced sales for their gaming consoles. Both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are going to be available for $299 this weekend only for Black Friday.
Let’s start with the Xbox One. Microsoft announced on Friday that all bundles would receive a $50 price cut from Thursday, November 26 through Monday, November 30 in the U.S. It means that entry-level bundles with a 500GB console and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition or The Lego Movie will cost $299.
Other bundles will also get a price cut in case you want a 1TB console and another game. Microsoft stores, Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Target, Toys “R” Us and Walmart will reflect the sale.
Microsoft has always been pretty aggressive with Black Friday sales when it comes to its consoles. But Sony didn’t wait long. Shortly after announcing a permanent price cut to $349, the company matched Microsoft’s offer for Black Friday.
From Friday, November 27 through Monday, November 30 in the U.S. and Canada, you’ll be able to buy a 500GB PlayStation 4 with the Uncharted collection for $299 (or $369 CAD). You can also expect sales on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Store.
As for Nintendo? The Wii U currently costs $299 with Mario Kart 8. But there is no sign of a Black Friday sale. Nintendo was already lagging behind its two competitors, it doesn’t look any better for holiday sales this year.
