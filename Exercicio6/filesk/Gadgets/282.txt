Last week we wrote about Timeular, a nifty little box that makes the dreaded chore of tracking your time at work easy, and now it is available on Kickstarter.
Essentially it is an eight-sided device that is Bluetooth-enabled and acts as a timer. You simply program each side to a different task and tip it when you’re working on a particular task or change to another.
The polyhedron is called the Zei and costs €69 (just under $79) for the first 1,000 early birds, and then €79 ($89) thereafter. There’s a cheaper option for a DIY model (€39) and, at the higher end, a series of packages that look targeted at larger companies with many employees that fill out timesheets for their work. That could be a legal practice, marketing agency or any business that works with clients and/or bills based on time.
Timeular was developed over a paid beta testing period that filled up quickly when announced earlier this year. Aside from the hardware, it includes compatible apps for tracking time spent on work and assigning tasks to the box. There’s also a pro version of the software with features designed to boost productivity. Timeular CEO Manuel Bruschi told us last week that the team is working to develop a productivity recommendation system, too.
The Austria-based company is aiming to raise €75,000 from this crowdfunding campaign — you can find full details on its Kickstarter page here.
