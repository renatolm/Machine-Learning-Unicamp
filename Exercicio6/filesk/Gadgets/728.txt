PlaySation Now, the all-you-can game subscription service that provides access to classic PlayStation titles on-demand, is making its way to Windows PCs, starting now in Europe and rolling out soon in North America. Sony’s also making it easier to game on your PC, with a DualShock 4 USB wireless controller adapter, letting you use your PlayStation 4 gamepads on both Mac and Windows computers.
The adapter is launching in early September, with a retail price of $24.99. It works with PlayStation Now, but perhaps more importantly for PS4 owners, it’ll also work for PS4 Remote Play, the Mac and PC app that lets you remotely play your PlayStation games from your computer over your local network connection. Until now, you’ve had to use a physical USB cable to connect your PS4 controller and use Remote Play on both Windows and Mac computers.
PlayStation Now debuted in June of last year on PS4, and now has over 400 games in its library. It streams games so you don’t actually have to install each title locally, and saves your progress to make it easy to pick up and play everywhere. It doesn’t have the very latest releases, but still boasts a lot of great classics including  God of War and Uncharted series instalments.
PS Now on PC requires Windows, as mentioned, with the following hardware specs (don’t worry, they’re not too steep):
