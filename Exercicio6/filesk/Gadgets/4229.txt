Google’s all excited about the official launch of its flagship Nexus devices. We’ve reviewed the 5X and 6P and since they’re both unlocked, you get to choose your carrier.
One option? Project Fi. It’s been closed off to the world up until now, but the team is opening the gates just for the rest of the day:
The lure of Project Fi is that it intelligently connects you to the best network…be it a 4G partner or freely available Wi-Fi. I’ve been using it with the Nexus 6P and so far, so good. I even was able to get access while driving to a mountainy part of northern California this weekend.

The pricing is more than comparable, if not better, than competing carriers like AT&T and Verizon.

I’m enjoying the easy-to-follow dashboards and info they share once you start going.

There’s also an app that tracks your usage.
Go sign up now. Hopefully it’s available in your neck of the woods.
