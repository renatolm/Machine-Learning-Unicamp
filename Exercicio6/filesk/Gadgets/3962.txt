Ever wanted a giant iPad? Well, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be available for purchase in 40 countries starting on Wednesday, November 11. It will first be available online with retail stores getting the device later in the week.
The Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard will also be available on Wednesday.
Pricing starts at $799 for the base model, which ships with 32GB of internal memory. For $1079 buyers can opt for the model that rocks both WiFi and cellular connectivity and 128GB of memory.
This new iPad isn’t just a larger screen. This behemoth sports a beautiful high-def 12.9″ screen with enough screen real estate to allow split, “full-screen” multitasking. The multi-touch screen is powered by a next-generation A9X chip that’s 1.8x faster than the A8 before it. The tablet features 10-hour battery life, 8MP iSight camera, Touch ID and four speaker audio.
