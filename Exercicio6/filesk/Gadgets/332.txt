Apple just released not one, not two but three new ads for its new devices — the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch Series 2. They all tout new features, such as water resistance, low light camera performance and new fitness features.
Let’s start with my favorite one. In “Midnight”, a young man goes for a night ride on his skateboard. He rides in the suburbs, sees a deer (!) at a gas station and ends up at the top of a hill, overseeing the city. It’s beautifully shot.

The second iPhone ad shows a man preparing his bike and iPhone for a ride during an epic rain. He’s using his iPhone with a handlebar mount. I hope he’s not going to die though…

The last ad features the Apple Watch Series 2 and focuses on fitness features. Yes, you can now swim with your Apple Watch, and do all sorts of dangerous sports. With this ad, it’s clear that Apple really wants you to consider the Apple Watch as a fitness-tracking device.

And in case you missed it, Apple released an awesome-looking iPhone 7 teaser video last week.
