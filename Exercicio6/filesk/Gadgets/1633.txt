I mean, I’m as excited about The Last Guardian as the next unwashed blogger, but you didn’t really think we were going to get out of tonight’s pre-E3 Sony press conference without a little hardware news, did you? And it’s 2016, after all, so it’s time for Sony to join the Oculus Rifts and HTC Vives of the world with its own VR offering.
Tonight the company went hard on virtual reality, kicking things off by announcing that the PlayStation VR headset will be hitting retail October 13th, priced at $399. And hey, what’s a little bit of gaming hardware without some, you know, games? The company also showed off a slew of those, adding that there will be 50 games available for the platform before the end of the year.
We got glimpses of a number of titles, featuring some gigantic names franchises, including VR experience offerings like Star Wars Battlefront: X-Wing VR Mission, Batman Arkham VR and Final Fantasy XV. The company will likely be showing off a few of these in more detail, so we’ll be sure to report back as soon as we get some quality hands- or head-on time with the hardware.
