Samsung keeps pulling back the old football for stateside consumers when it comes to the Gear 360. Shortly after it was first introduced back in February at Mobile World Congress, the company noted that the U.S. would not be among the first markets to get their hands on the VR camera.
Several months later, the 360 is available here in the states, but only kind of, sort of. The camera’s first official U.S. availability comes in an extremely limited basis, as it’s put up for purchase at the VidCon convention in Anaheim, California this week for $350.
The camera will be getting more widespread availability here later this year, but details are still forthcoming.
The limited availability comes as Samsung revamps its VR video service, dropping the unfortunate “Milk” name in favor of the far more functional Samsung VR. Users can upload and share video content created on the new semi-available camera, viewable through the Oculus-powered Gear VR headset.
Samsung also worked with a slew of creators in the lead up to VidCon, including YouTube star Casey Neistat, to create more VR video content. Next month, the company will be launching a VR/360 video competition to showcase work created for the emerging format.
