Get ready for the Google Monocle. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted a new patent to Google for a potential upcoming version of Google Glass. The best way to put it is that it doesn’t look like a pair of glasses anymore — it’s a glorious monocle that wraps around your head.
Here’s an abstract from the patent:
Once you configure it, Glass should retain its configuration. The question is whether this will be enough to revive interest for this device.
As a reminder, Google halted sales of Glass back in January. The company later said that it needed to “pause” and “reset” development of the device.
In March, we reported that Google was looking for new areas of opportunity for Glass. In particular, Google could sell Glass to enterprise customers.
But the company has been mostly silent since then. It’s unclear whether Google is still working on software and hardware improvements. But it looks like today’s new patent proves that Google hasn’t given up just yet.
