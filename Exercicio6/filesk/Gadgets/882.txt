The first OSVR headset made its debut at last year’s CES. The wearable wasn’t aimed at Oculus or HTC – nor were its creators looking to take on Samsung’s low cost Gear VR. Rather, the prototype represented the first step in a multi-company effort to build a new, non-proprietary paradigm in the burgeoning world of virtual reality.
And Min Liang-Tan helped lead the charge. His company, Razer, has been offering some of the most innovative gaming products since its inception, swinging for the fences with tablets, modular PCs, an ultra-thin portable gaming laptop and even a dual-screen smartwatch.
It goes without saying that we’re very excited to be joined by Tan on the Disrupt SF stage (September 12 – September 14).
OSVR (or Open Source Virtual Reality) is a natural fit for a company looking to push gaming devices forward, offering up an open-source ecosystem where hardware developers can bring peripherals designed to help further immersion for the technology.
Tan co-founded Razer in 2005 as an outgrowth his team’s late-90s attempts to build an early gaming-specific mouse, a project that gave rise to the original Razer Boomslang. Since then, the company has been a leading force in gaming peripherals, an Tan has been named to countless lists of top influencers and entrepreneurs.
He’ll be joining us onstage in September at Pier 48 to discuss Razer’s role in the future of gaming at Disrupt San Francisco, September 12-14th. You can purchase tickets to the event here.
