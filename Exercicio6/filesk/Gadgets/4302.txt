CNN and NextVR are teaming up Tuesday night to make you feel like you’re sitting in the audience at the Democratic debate. Though CNN broadcast the Republican debate earlier this year in virtual reality, Tuesday will mark the first time viewers will be able to stream a debate using the technology in real time.
According to a news release, Samsung GearVR headset owners can access the debate by visiting the NextVR portal in the Oculus Store.
Though some are joking about the technology on Twitter, the first live news broadcast in virtual reality marks a significant milestone for the news industry. Just as TV and the Internet have already transformed the way we learn about and experience news, virtual reality could be the next step in bringing us closer to a major event.
