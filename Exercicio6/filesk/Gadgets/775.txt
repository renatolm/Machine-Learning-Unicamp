And if you’ve been eyeing one, go ahead and pull the trigger. It’s a really great phone. Assuming, of course, that you’ve got, you know, $800-plus burning a hole in your pocket.
The 5.7-inch phablet is available now from a whole slew of retailers, including, naturally, Samsung’s stores, plus Best Buy, Target, Sam’s Club, some Walmart stores (maybe call ahead on that one), and online through Amazon. It’ll hit all the big carrier stores tomorrow — i.e. AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular and Verizon.
The big new phone will be joined at retail by a number of recently announced Sammy gadgets, including the Gear VR, those IconX wireless earbuds, Level Active headphones and the Gear 360 VR camera (online only). Availability details differ from product to product, but you can get your hands on all of them right now, one way or another.
