The Cullen Jones endorsed wearable counts laps, tracks activities and sleep, does text and call notifications and features a vibrating swim timer. It also has multicolor LEDs, a battery that lasts up to six months, and, naturally, is water-resistant up to 50 meters. There’s also a Speedo logo etched into the back for good measure.
