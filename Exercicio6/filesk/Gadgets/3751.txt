Elon Musk is looking for a few good engineers. The Tesla CEO took to Twitter tonight to announce Tesla is ramping up its autonomous vehicle division and needs some new talent. Oh, and he said he’s going to do some of the interviews, so there’s that too.
To apply Musk simply says to email the company and include a link to examples of your work. It’s important to note that Musk stated that the company is looking for software engineers and experience with automobiles is not required. After all, vehicles are increasing becoming more software than hardware.
This division of Tesla is responsible for the company’s so-called Autopilot system, which is the system that turns its Model S sedan into a quasi-autonomous vehicle. Autopilot doesn’t take complete control of the car but does allow the vehicle to navigate highway traffic and road hazards unlike Google’s self-driving cars that are completely autonomous.
A Tesla rep told TechCrunch following the Autopilot’s launch that this may have been due to the lighting conditions at the time; if the car’s AI isn’t 100% confident that it’s safe to change lanes, it just won’t. Better to have a driver take over than to autosteer into something it somehow missed, right?
Elon Musk says he sees full automation coming within about 3 years; Autopilot is just a big first step. But it might be here sooner than that. Tesla is clearly ready to ramp up development.
