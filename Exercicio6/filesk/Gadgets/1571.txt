The story goes that last week, a Tesla Model S drove through a flooded tunnel in Kazakhstan. It’s not clear in the video below if the car was actually floating, but that didn’t stop Elon Musk from taking to Twitter to turn the video into a bit of Tesla marketing.
Musk failed to indicate the specifics about what makes the Model S buoyant enough to float. Yet as an electric vehicle, the Model S does not rely on air like an internal combustion engine so, in theory, the car’s systems should be able to operate underwater (or on water) as long as they’re properly sealed against the water pressure.
Don’t try this with your Model S, though. As Electrek points out, Tesla’s warranty does not cover water damage.
