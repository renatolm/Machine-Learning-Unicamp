We get it. You’re busy building a robot that can eat human food. That’s why we’ve extended the deadline for applications for TechCrunch’s Hardware Battlefield for a few more days. Submit your application by November 23 at 9pm PT to compete for free demo space at the Consumer Electronics Show, $50,000 prize and the Metal Man trophy.
For those of you following along at home, Hardware Battlefield is part of TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield series, but with a few small differences. Of course, there is the requirement that participating companies must have a hardware component to their product. In today’s world that means everything from IoT devices to 3D printing, wearables to robots.
Hardware Battlefield takes places at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Battlefield contestants still have 6 minutes to pitch to our judging panel followed by 6 minutes of live Q/A. Judges include hardware investors like Rob Coneybeer, Highway1 and HAX, top designers like Yves Behar and product experts like Susan Paley.
This year the TechCrunch is going bigger. This year’s booth is located right at the Mezzanine of the Sands Expo which means that any and everyone walking to check out exhibits will be stopping by TechCrunch.
Only in its third year, the Hardware Battlefield teams are already making a name for themselves. Owlet raised a $7M Series A. Peeple launched a successful kickstarter, Sereneti Kitchen participated in Highway1.
Applying and participating in the Hardware Battlefield is entirely free and we welcome entries from across the globe.
Startups must have a functional prototype to demo to the selection committee. TechCrunch will give preference to companies that debuting a product for the first time to the public and press through the competition.
So, looking for a way to stand out from the noise at CES? Want to get feedback from the biggest gadgets enthusiasts on the planet? Apply now to be a part of Hardware Battlefield!
