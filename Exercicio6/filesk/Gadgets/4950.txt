As we enter the next Information Age, we must take only a few things with us. For example, this ashtray. Just this ashtray. And this paddle game. The ashtray and the paddle game and that’s all you need. And this remote control. And also this teeny tiny Apple computer.
The project, created by Charles Mangin, is essentially a Raspberry Pi Model A+ case shaped like an Apple IIc. You can download the files here and print it yourself or simply buy a nicer version on Etsy. Either way you basically get a little IIc case and monitor that you can simply plug into the computer. Add in a USB keyboard and mouse and you can run either Raspbian Linux or even Apple emulators on the smallest computer known to man in history. Add an SD card reader that looks like a floppy disk drive and you’re really cooking.
You can buy the parts for $50 each if you want them pre-printed and painted. DIYers can simply fend for themselves. Mangin also wishes to note that “The keyboard does not work.”
