Forget electric skateboards and faux hoverboards. One startup is trying to convince commuters to stick to the good old-fashioned bicycle. Meet the Gi FlyBike, a folding electric bike that can travel up to 40 miles on one charge.
The bike, which is now available on Kickstarter, will also be for sale on Amazon Exclusives, the e-commerce company’s online store featuring “up-and-coming brands.”
Started by three friends from Argentina, Gi FlyBike was conceived after a public transportation strike left the entire country without transportation.
So how does an electric bike work? While riders still pedal, they are assisted by an electric engine that will propel them to a maximum speed of 15 mph. The motor also works on hills and rough terrain, meaning riders aren’t limited to the street.
The bike itself is made of aircraft grade aluminum, and weighs 37 pounds, allowing it to quickly fold in half for storage or car travel.
Having a battery pack strapped to the back of a bike presents a great deal of technological opportunities, which the Gi FlyBike takes full advantage of.
For example, the bike has a built-in phone charger, so you can use the onboard battery to charge your device while you ride. The battery also powers a smart locking system; a folded bike will automatically lock when you are 15 feet away. Riders can even use the company’s app to transfer unlock privileges to a friend, letting them temporarily borrow your bike.
The bike, which has already raised almost $300,000 more than its goal of $75,000, is currently available on Kickstarter for a pre-order price of $2,290.
