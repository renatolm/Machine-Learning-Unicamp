Android Wear smartwatches come in many shapes and sizes — their watch bands, however, do not.
Every manufacturer has their own set, and some have different bands for different watches. To add to the complexity, some users end up going the DIY route, with varying levels of success.
Also, it’s worth noting how easy it is switch out Apple Watch bands, while Android Wear hasn’t had the same treatment, until now.
That’s where Mode (branded as “MODE”) comes in. It’s Google’s new standard, just for watch bands. A simple sliding mechanism lets you swap out both straps for a different pair. Silicone or leather options are available, each coming with a watch band removal tool.
Currently, there are six silicone watch bands, in four sizes, starting at $49. For the formal leather look, Google is starting off with ten unique leather bands, in six sizes, starting at $59. To stay strong in terms of quality, Google sourced the bands to Hadley Roma, a 103-year-old American watch attachment company.
As for sizing, there’s a Mode watch size dropdown that asks you what watch you have, and shows what kinds of bands will fit.
Sales of the new Mode watch bands start today via Best Buy, the Google Store and Amazon.
