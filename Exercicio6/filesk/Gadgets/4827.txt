Don’t call it a hobby. Amazon is serious about its living room aspirations and is about to launch a second-generation Fire TV media receiver. The company launched the original Fire TV a year-and-a-half ago, and it includes a similar feature set as the newly revamped Apple TV. From voice search to apps to games, the original Fire TV packs a punch, and the new one seems to be even stronger.
The company’s upcoming device was recently uncovered by Dave Zatz, who found the device listed on the FCC website under a shell name. A new microSD card slot is listed in the documentation along with 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity, an ethernet port and USB port. But hardware specs doesn’t sell gadgets alone.
At this point it’s unclear if the new Fire TV packs an updated interface or renewed focus on gaming — both of which are needed to properly stand tall against the new Apple TV. And as Dave Zatz points out, 4k output, which could be a killer feature for some, is still up in the air.
Chances are good that the company is gearing up to launch this new model very soon. Amazon generally unveils new hardware in early fall, and Amazon currently lists the original Fire TV as unavailable.
