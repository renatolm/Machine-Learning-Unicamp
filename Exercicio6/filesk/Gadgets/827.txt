Samsung will introduce (yet) another smartwatch this month. The Korea-based giant teased a launch event at the IFA electronics show in Germany, the date to watch for is August 31 and, as the invite above rather heavy-handedly hints, this will be the Gear S3.
Smartwatch sales reportedly dipped by one-third this year, according to analyst estimates. Samsung was one of a number of firms to hold or improve its numbers — Apple’s estimated sales cratered — and it is back with a new offering in an effort to increase interest, notably right before Apple is predicted to refresh its own smartwatch range in September.
The Gear S2, Samsung’s most recent smartwatch, launched in September 2015 at the very same show. The company’s early watch models struggled for acclaim, but we found the Gear S2 to be surprisingly good, with an attractive interface and well-designed spinning bezel. That leaves us and doubtless others intrigued by what Samsung has planned next.
What hints can we glean from the Gear S2? Well, the year-old device is available in two options — as the Samsung Gear S2 3G or the Gear S2 Classic — and Samsung later expanded the watch options to include Apple-esque gold and silver editions. There’s speculation that Samsung will go further and out three versions of the Gear S3 this time around, including an ‘explorer’ edition that could feature a crown, more buttons and changeable watch bands.
Either way, there’s not long to wait to find out for sure. Like other Samsung unveilings, the Gear S3 launch event will be streamed online so you can watch at your own convenience.
