Apple is holding an event today in Apple’s own Cupertino HQ, in its Town Hall Theater. The event kicks off at 10 AM PT (1 PM ET, 5 PM GMT, 6 PM CET), and we’ll have a team covering the event. I’ll be handling the liveblog from Cupertino throughout the event, and you can also expect hands-on videos and up-to-the-minute articles unpacking all the announcements. Rumor has it that Apple is going to announce a smaller iPhone, a successor to the iPad Air 2 as well as software updates. This could also be Apple’s last event in the Town Hall Theater as the company is building a bigger auditorium for its new campus.
