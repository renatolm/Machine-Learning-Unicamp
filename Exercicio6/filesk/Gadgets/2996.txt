During the 2015 Special Olympics World Games in Los Angeles last week, a fifth grader named Ari stopped by a booth set up by Google. The booth had information about its “Impact Challenge” for disabilities. What Ari didn’t know is that her life would change before she left the games.
A few volunteers from AIO Robotics swung by and fitted Ari for a new colorful prosthetic hand, since she was born without fingers on the left one. The broader appeal of the booth was a demo from a group called “e-NABLE,” which is a network of volunteers printing 3D prosthetics for kids specifically.

Hopefully you caught Ari’s mega-huge smile as soon as they fitted her with the bright-pink prosthetic. Go ahead, watch it again.

Okay, okay. One more? How about eight-year-old Isabella being gifted a brand new hand thanks to e-NABLE:

Isn’t technology awesome?
