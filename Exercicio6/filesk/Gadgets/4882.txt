Apple unveiled its new iPad Pro today. If you’re wondering when you can get your hands on it, and how much it will cost, here you go: Apple says the iPad Pro and related accessories will be available in November.
Pricing will start at $799 with 32 gigabytes of memory and WiFi-only connectivity, with a $949 price tag for 128 GB, and $1,079 for 128 GB and a cellular connection. If you want the company’s new stylus, dubbed the Apple Pencil, that’ll cost you $99, and the Smart Keyboard will cost $169.
That may seem pretty pricey compared to other iPads — in fact, Apple said today that it’s dropping pricing on its iPad Mini 2, which its considers to be the entry-level iPad, to $269. What you’re paying for (among other things) is a 12.9-inch screen with resolution of 2,732 x 2,048 pixels, Apple’s A9X chip and four speakers.
And, as the name and on-stage demos suggest, Apple seems to be pitching this for enterprise use and productivity, not for casual use.
