Now that Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, it’s time to look at this year’s iPhone lineup. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be available to pre-order on September 9 and will ship a week later on September 16. The base iPhone 7 model with 32GB will cost $649. There will be a 128GB model as well as a 256GB model. Usually, you have to pay $100 more to get more gigs.
The 32GB iPhone 7 Plus will cost a bit more and start at $769. Again, you can pay more to get more storage. You’ll be able to pay $27 or $32 per month to get the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus respectively on carrier installment plans.
The iPhone SE, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are sticking around. This time, Apple is keeping two storage levels for each phone and bumping up the storage as well for the 6s and 6s Plus — 32GB and 128GB. The iPhone SE won’t change, you’ll be able to buy a 16GB and 64GB iPhone SE.
The iPhone Upgrade Plan that was introduced last year is sticking around. So you’ll be able to pay a monthly fee to get an iPhone and AppleCare+ directly from Apple. The iPhone Upgrade Plan is also expanding to the U.K. and China.
All devices will ship at first in 28 countries, with 30 more countries one week later.
