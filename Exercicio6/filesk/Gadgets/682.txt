It’s a good day for photographers who favor the Fujifilm system. The camera company announced an update to its X-A series mirrorless cameras and solid new lens today.
The X-A3’s main update is the sensor, a new 24.2-megapixel model — up from 16 on the X-A2. Unfortunately, although the megapixel count is similar, it isn’t the same sensor or image processor as you’d find in the X-Pro2 and X-T2, Fuji’s high-end mirrorless offerings — it uses a regular Bayer-type layout, not Fuji’s proprietary X-Trans (if you don’t know what those are, don’t worry about it). It does, however, have expanded focus modes and, of course, a few million more pixels on it than its predecessor.
To videographers’ delight, the X-A2 will also now shoot at 60p, 50p, and 24p in addition to the standard 30p. No 4K, though; you’re limited to 1080/720 vertical pixels.

This camera is at the low end of the interchangeable lens pile, meaning it’s aimed at a more casual crowd — the kind that appreciates a good selfie. To that end, the rear LCD flips up, and the camera begins hunting for eyes to focus on. You can also set it up so you hit the shutter button but the shot only fires when you and your friends all get near each other and smile.
This is all on the well-established and charming retro-style, dial-covered body that Fujifilm has excelled in creating over the last few years. There’s an improved faux leather finish now, too.
You’ll be able to pick up the X-A3 for $600 with the standard 16-60mm F3.5-5.6 kit lens, or less without. Get the black one.
If you already have a decent camera body, though, you might be tempted by the lens Fuji announced today. It’s a $450 23mm F/2 that, unlike many of its brethren at that focal length and speed, is also weather sealed.
Keep in mind that there’s not much point to that unless your camera is sealed, too — something that doesn’t happen until the X-T series in the Fujifilm lineup.
