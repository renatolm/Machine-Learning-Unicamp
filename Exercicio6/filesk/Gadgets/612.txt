Intel’s latest processor generation is now official, and the 7th generation of Core processors looks to pack a punch. The so-called “Kaby Lake” lineup is the first to follow the new “tick-tock-tock” beat Intel has adopted for processor development, which means it keeps the same 14nm manufacturing process as its predecessor (Skylake), but there’s still lots to love here, including power efficiency, speed and big potential for 4K video and gaming on the move.
Kaby Lake also introduces support for powerful new I/O options (like some of the ones rumoured for upcoming Mac hardware refreshes) including USB-C with additional functions via Thunderbolt 3, and greater support for fine pen-based input, which should complement the recent Windows 10 Anniversary Update’s introduction of system-level ink support. These and other features make Kaby Lake a natural fit for ultraportables, and for 2-in-1s, the convertible category of tablet/notebook hybrids that PC makers and a decent chunk of consumers have been embracing of late.

The new processors also boast greatly improved performance for playing backhand working with 4K video, which is good news as the standard becomes more commonly supported in playback devices including TVs and monitors. VR support also gets a bump with these 7th gen Core processor.
So how soon can we expect to see Kaby Lake-powered computers on store shelves? Intel tells Slashgear the wait won’t be long; chips are already being mass-produced and are going out to PC manufacturers starting in September, which launches for “hundreds” of units planned during Q4 this year.
