There’s no shortage of portable Bluetooth speakers out there, but lord are a lot of them ugly. What I need is something that will not look amiss sitting on a stump next to me while I hew a yew in my red plaid flannel. Wait, what’s this one?!
The Rock Out 2 is the latest from GoalZero, which is better known for its solar chargers and emergency batteries. It’s a collab with Woolrich, the familiar — well, to lumberjacks — outdoor clothing company that has made a specific black and red plaid its trademark pattern.
Don’t pretend you don’t know the name and possibly fear it. Wireless audio was the natural step for these venerable outdoorspeople.
You can expect the speaker to do all the usual tricks: It has two 3-watt drivers, a mic for taking calls “from your crew” while it’s synced to your phone and a headphone input, as well. It’s also weather-proof, suggesting it’ll handle a cloudbreak or roll in the duff just fine (but don’t take it swimming with you).
You can pick up the checked Rock Out 2 at GoalZero for $80.
