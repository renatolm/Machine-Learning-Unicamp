Happy Friday! 
To soothe you from the hectic bustle of the fall work week and transition you into a peaceful, potentially football-filled weekend, we come bearing the TechCrunch Gadgets podcast. 
All that said, it isn’t the most uplifting 30 minutes of conversation had among colleagues, as we discuss the ludicrous Keurig Kold and our diminishing patience for new wearables. 
We discuss all this and more on this week’s episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast, featuring John Biggs, Matt Burns, Romain Dillet, and Jordan Crook.
We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here.
