At the Microsoft event this morning, the company’s No. 2, Terry Myerson, announced that the company will be upgrading all of its Xbox One systems to Windows 10. That means the company’s fanboys will be able to play Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One.
The company is also introducing limited-edition consoles inspired by games. The Halo5 console, Myerson’s favorite, comes with 1 terabyte of storage and will retail for $499. Rumors have been that this will be dropping in November, but Myerson did not give a specific release date.
With the announcement, Microsoft comes one step closer to completing its promise to bring Windows10 to all hardware classes.
“Xbox One is going to bring some serious fun this holiday,” Myerson told the breathless (if somewhat groggy) crowd.
