Withings has one more thing up its sleeve, a new activity tracker. This isn’t a new version of the Pulse or Activité. This is a brand new activity tracker. And the best part is that it only costs $69.
The Withings Go uses an always-on E Ink display like the one on your Kindle or original Pebble. It’s very power efficient but it’s also a black and white display. The good thing about this kind of display is that the Withings Go uses a button cell battery which lasts 8 months.
This new device tracks your steps, distance, running and swimming activity. You can also use it to track your sleep cycles. Compared to other entry-level activity trackers, you can do quite a lot. You don’t have to switch between activities — the device switches automatically.
And of course, you can get your data in the Withings Health Mate app on iOS and Android. The Withings Go will be available in Q1 2016.
Now the question is whether people want yet another Nike FuelBand style device or they’re ready for a smartwatch. Many people already bought activity trackers from FitBit, Jawbone and Withings and don’t use them anymore. For other people, the Withings Go can be a good way to see if you need an activity tracker in your life. But chances are you’ll want to go to the next level if you like it.
