Nintendo had a very good month in mobile gaming, according to NPD Group’s latest data. The 3DS won in both hardware and software sales for the analyst firm’s latest tracker report, with the 3DS and its family of systems (including New 3DS, 3DS XL and 2DS devices) up 80 percent for July this year versus July 2015. Pokémon Omega Red and Alpha Sapphire, the latest console titles in the franchise, were also up over 80 percent year-over-year.
The halo effect doesn’t stop at the latest and greatest in Pokémon console games, however: Sales of Pokémon X and Y, which were first released in October 2013, were up a huge 200 percent compared to their sales in July of last year.
Confession: At least one of those sales can be directly attributed to me, and a sample size of one reveals that said purchase was driven directly by Pokémon Go hype.
Nintendo’s strong July wasn’t only a result of Pokémon Go carry-over interest, however; games for Nintendo systems took five of the top 11 spots for software sales overall, with Monster Hunter Generations coming in at a strong No. 1, and Minecraft: Wii U edition, Pokemon Omega Ruby and Sapphire (both games that came out nearly two years ago) and Kirby: Planet Robot also making solid showings.
While Nintendo may not be making much directly from Pokémon Go in terms of percentage of revenue, the franchise’s big move to smartphones is still filling the sales of the game company in key ways, and that’s a great set up for the launch of Pokémon Sun and Moon for 3DS this November.
