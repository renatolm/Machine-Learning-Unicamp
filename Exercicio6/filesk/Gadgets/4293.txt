Good morrow to you madam or sir! I would like to call your attention to a unique and fun opportunity. I, John Biggs, want you to show off your hardware in London at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference in London. Huzzah!
Disrupt London runs from December 7-8, 2015. Hardware Alley day is on the 8th and you’ll receive tickets to both days of Disrupt. We invite everyone – from bootstrapped prototypers to seasoned makers – to join us!
What is Hardware Alley? It’s a celebration of hardware startups (and other cool gear makers) featuring everything from robotic drones to 3D printers. We try to bring in an eclectic mix of amazing exhibitors and I think you’ll agree that our previous Alleys have been roaring successes.
All you need to demo is a laptop. TechCrunch provides you with: 30″ round cocktail table, linens, table-top sign, inclusion in program agenda and website, exhibitor WiFi, and press list.
You can reserve your spot by purchasing a Hardware Alley Exhibitor Package here.
If you are Kickstarting your project now or bootstrapping, please contact me at john@techcrunch.com with the subject line “HARDWARE ALLEY.” I will do my best to accommodate you. I only have a limited number of discounted spots so hurry!
