Apple has just issued invites for its next press event on the Apple Campus in Cupertino. The event is going to happen on March 21. As usual, Apple wrote a cryptic message on its invites — “Let us loop you in.”
The event has been rumored for weeks, and we already expect a few things. Rumor has it that Apple has been working on a new iPhone. This iPhone should feature a 4-inch display like the one in the iPhone 5s, but with an updated chip and camera.
It’s unclear if it’s going to be called the iPhone 5se (for “special edition”), the iPhone SE or something else. Updates for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are unlikely.
Next up, we have the iPad Air. Last Fall, Apple updated the iPad mini and unveiled the iPad Pro. There was no word on the iPad Air. It looks like the company needed more time to work on a new 9.7-inch tablet.
But there’s a twist. The new iPad should work with the Apple Pencil and feature a smart connector to work with a keyboard cover. Think about it as a smaller iPad Pro more than an iPad Air 3.
And then, there’s the Apple Watch. “Let us loop you in” could mean something about the Apple Watch. But according to our own Matthew Panzarino, you shouldn’t expect an Apple Watch 2 just yet. Instead, Apple could announce new bands and partnerships with fashion companies.
What else? We’ll have to wait and see. The good news is that TechCrunch is going to have a team on the ground to cover the event. Apple usually holds events on Tuesdays, but March 21 is on a Monday. The reason why it’s on a Monday this time is that Apple will be at its first hearing regarding the Apple vs. FBI case on March 22.
