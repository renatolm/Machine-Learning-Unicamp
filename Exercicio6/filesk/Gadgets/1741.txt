Admittedly, Atari isn’t the entertainment powerhouse it once was. The company has spent the last few years digging attempting to reinvent itself after declaring bankruptcy in 2013, focusing largely on mobile gaming plays and casino deals. Now the one-time gaming juggernaut is lending its legendary name to a line of connected home devices.
It’s not exactly a new console, sadly, but the iconic brand will grace “a wide range of new Atari products” created by French wireless networking company, Sigfox.
There’s not a lot in the way of details surrounding what appears to largely be a licensing deal, but the initial products will include low priced home, pet, lifestyle and safety devices, featuring Sigfox’s low-energy technology.
The products are said to be targeted toward both at mass-market consumers and charity organizations.
