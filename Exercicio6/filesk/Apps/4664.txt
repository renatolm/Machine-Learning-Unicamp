The Brooklyn TC Meetup crept up faster than any of us anticipated. In just two short days, we’ll head over to Output in Williamsburg and ten companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their wares to a panel of judges and an adoring, primarily hipster audience.
But which companies have been selected?
Without any further ado, I’m pleased to introduce the startups pitching at the Brooklyn Pitch-Off on March 1 at 6pm:
After their sixty-second pitches, judges will conduct a quick Q&A and eventually determine the winners.
First place gets a table at Startup Alley at Disrupt NY in May. Second place gets two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner walks home with one ticket.
Tickets are still available to the event, which you can buy here. We simply ask that you are 21 years of age to attend.
See you guys on Tuesday!
