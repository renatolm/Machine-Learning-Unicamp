Tinder is discontinuing use of the app for everyone under the age of 18 starting next week, according to a statement from Tinder VP of Communications Rosette Pambakian.
The dating app has allowed everyone 13 years of age or older to use the app since it launched back in 2012. Anyone between 13 and 17 years old was only allowed to match with others in that pool.
However, that is all changing with today’s announcement, which requires that users be over 18 to sign on and start swiping.
Here is Tinder’s official statement:
“We’ve been reviewing this policy since early this year and believe it’s the right thing to do,” said Pambakian.
This follows an earlier announcement from Tinder promising a new transgender-friendly user experience (though the company has yet to elaborate on what that might look like).
That said, Tinder’s massive and growing user base requires even tighter specification and enforcement of policy to keep the dating app safe for its users.
Tinder said that this impacts less than 3 percent of the global user base.
“A number of factors go into making a decision like this, but we’re confident we landed on the right policy,” said Pambakian.
