Want to develop an app for the newly released Apple TV? Of course you do. Not sure how to get started? Apple is touring the globe for “Apple TV Tech Talks” which promise to get you rocking. You have to register by November 13th, though…so hop to it.

Here’s how Apple describes them:
And here’s the “schedule” of what you’ll experience:

You have to be enrolled in Apple’s developer program already to take part, which is more than worth it in my opinion. It gets you all of the goodies early and you’re the first to hear about the newest updates across all of Apple’s devices.
As proved by the original iPhone launch, the platform is only the first part…killer apps sell the product. Apple needs you…and your apps.
