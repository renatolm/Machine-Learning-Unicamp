According to a tweet from Mike Davidson, Twitter is about to lose its Vice President of Design:

No other information was given on what’s next for him or where Twitter will look for design direction.
With “nothing sacred” at Twitter as far as changes to features and design, perhaps the company will go fast and loose without need for this particular high-level spot.
We’ve reached out to Twitter for comment and will update if we hear more.
