Twitter tweeted out a new toy for you to play with for video called “ScratchReel.” Basically, it lets you scrub a short GIF back and forth for cool effects.
Check it out here (to see the actual effect you have to visit the native tweet):
According to The Verge, this feature was introduced by the team that came over with SnappyTV, which Twitter acquired in 2014.
One could imagine that GIFs are pretty popular on the platform, so dropping toys like this makes the content more engaging. Your favorite cat GIFs just got a little bit cooler. It’s good to see the Flock making stuff and pushing them out to the world quickly.
