I’m still trying to deal with losing Pokévision, too, but Niantic’s recent changes to the game don’t seem to be putting a damper on player appetite just yet — new data from analytics firm Sensor Tower reveals that users are still spending, on average, around 26 minutes per day in the app in the U.S., which is actually a slight increase compared to the average play duration the week prior to the update’s arrival.
And yes, users are still opening the app about the same amount of time, too — around six times per day, for the most part.


Meanwhile, users have also spent a pretty penny on various Poké-accoutrements during its less than 30 days of existence: Sensor Tower estimates about $160 million in total revenue, which makes sense given App Annie now says it’s netting about $10 million daily from its user pool, which has grown considerably since launch with the addition of new markets.
While Nintendo is only going to see a relatively small direct upside from that net revenue figure, it’s benefiting in other ways from Go’s continued success: 3DS sales of the most recent Pokémon series installment for that platform have doubled since Go’s debut.
