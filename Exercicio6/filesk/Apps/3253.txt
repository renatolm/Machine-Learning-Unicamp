It seems like 2015 was the year of the “emoji.” I mean, a damn emoji was the “word of the year.” This year is ending with a massive bang on the App Store thanks to Kim Kardashian and her…assets.
Fire up the App Store on your devices and here’s what you’ll see for the top paid app:

The app, KIMOJI, costs $1.99. What do you get? Well, emojis having to do with Kim Kardashian, of course. Not bad for a keyboard app, eh?

It currently has 2 stars, so maybe people aren’t getting as much out of it as they thought. The initial popularity certainly spun up tons of interest though, as the App Store magically went down during the flurry of asscitement:
Did Kardashian really take down the App Store?
No, but it’s still a fun story.
Her hubbie is certainly proud, as I would be too:
Happy Kardashian Holidays, y’all!
