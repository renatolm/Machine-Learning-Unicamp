Today, Google acquired Fly Labs to join its Google Photos team. The company aimed to help people edit videos and photos and it sported 3 million downloads over the past 18 months. Their suite of apps (Tempo, Fly and Crop) will be made available for the next three months. You’ll still be able to use them, but there will be no more updates.
We recently played around with their app “Clips” and it was pretty rad. See our interview below:
Product Lead on Google Photos, David Lieb, shared some of his thoughts on the acquisition:
Here’s the note from the team on the acquisition. Terms were not disclosed.
After breaking free from Google+ as its own product, Google Photos recently passed the 100M user mark. Those users have uploaded 50 billion photos and videos.
