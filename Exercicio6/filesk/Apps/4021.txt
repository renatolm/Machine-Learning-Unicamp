Following trading today, Etsy reported its Q3 financial performance, including revenue of $66 million, and earnings loss per share of $0.06. The Street expected Etsy to lose $0.06 per share, off revenue of around $66.17 million. So that’s a “met expectations.” The company reported 1.5 million active sellers and 22.6 million active buyers.
The company was up 3.18 percent today, trading at just over $11 at market close. When the company went public this year, it sat pretty at a mean $30 per share. That has trailed off considerably as shares of Etsy are down around an alarming 8% in after-hours trading.

Etsy wants everyone to know that it’s the most important, and profitable, quarter of the year for them: “We have launched a holiday campaign that we believe is our strongest holiday effort to date.”
