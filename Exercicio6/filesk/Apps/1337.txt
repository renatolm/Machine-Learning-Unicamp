The app that brings two hearts plus one
together with a mobile app,
Its name was one but now is gone
with a mighty legal slap.
Too close for Tinder’s rights of copy
its name was fought but then repealed.
Changing after getting stroppy
from Thrinder to the saucy ‘Feeld.’
Already on the phones from Apple
the app now, too, on And-er-oid.
Ready for some sweaty grapple
worthy of the dreams of Freud.
