The Europas Conference & Awards for European Tech Startups is on on June 16 in London, and TechCrunch is the exclusive Media Partner. Think ‘a summertime Crunchies, with a daytime unconference attached, by a sunny River Thames’. The agenda for the event has just been released. You can find it here and the roster of international speakers is here.
Attendees will automatically receive deep discounts on Disrupt Europe tickets among other perks. Tickets to the daytime conference are limited, but you can grab the last ones here, or here for the evening awards only.
The Europas celebrate some of the most forward-thinking and innovative European tech companies across some 20-plus categories. Over the last few weeks startups have been able to either apply for an award or be nominated by a third party. A judging panel then selected a shortlist of nominees, which was submitted to public voting. Finally those results were combined. Previous Europas winners have included Supercell, Layar, Podio, BlaBlaCar, SoundCloud, Seedcamp, Socialbakers, Mind Candy and King.com. The voting has now taken place, the feedback collated, the shortlist is out, and the winners will be announced at the end of the conference in a fun awards ceremony. Prior to the finale, The Europas “unconference” of invited guests, features relaxed networking and small group discussion sessions.
This year, The Europas is adding a parallel event, PathFounders (June 15th-17th), designed to bring early-stage founders together with investors. PathFounders will bring a select group of 100 of Europe’s early-stage founders, VCs and angel investors. Eligible daytime conference ticket holders will receive an invite to upgrade their ticket to include this. Email TheEuropas@gmail.com for details.
