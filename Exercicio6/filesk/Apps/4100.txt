Twitch? Who needs it. Today, Google Play Games announced a new feature which will let you record and share your gameplay moments with others. No, it’s not for streaming hours of footage, it’s more for when you want to share yourself beating a level or getting a high score. You can then pop it onto YouTube Gaming to get those views and make that revenues.
Here’s what the team had to say:
This will be a nice addition for those of you flinging games to your TV with the new Chromecast. The video uploads to YouTube first, of course, and then you can share it on your social channel of choice.
Yup, so think of this as Twitch Light. YouTube says that 144 billion minutes of gaming videos and livestreams are watched on the platform, so any way they can come up with to get more content there is great for them. And for gamers.
The Android update for Google Play Games is rolling out over the next few days to the US and UK first.
