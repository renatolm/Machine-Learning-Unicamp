During Apple’s keynote in September, they announced that Facebook Messenger would be coming to the Apple Watch, as long as you’ve updated to watchOS 2. Well, it’s here. 
You can now share things like voice clips, likes and stickers from your Apple Watch. From my experience, little interactions like this are what works best on the Watch. I’ve found that as soon as I have to do anything more than pick a person and an action, things go haywire. Sure, there’s a lot more to do with watchOS, but I’d say that 2 is lightyears ahead of what the device shipped with.
When Messenger for Apple Watch was first announced, our own Josh Constine said:
Welp, they’re there now.
Along with Apple Watch support, Facebook Messenger for iOS gained spotlight integration and multi-tasking for iPad. Spotlight integration is super clutch, because you can now easily search through your Messenger contacts and messages without opening the app.
