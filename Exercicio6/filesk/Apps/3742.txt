If you’re a Dungeons & Dragons fan, and happen to have some virtual reality gear on you, drop what you’re doing. Social VR company AltspaceVR has shipped an immersive version of your beloved tabletop role playing game.
AltspaceVR teamed up with D&D publishers Wizards of the Coast for the experience.

The companies say that this fills the void for D&D players who have moved around the world and don’t have their buddies to play with anymore in person. This is just one of the promises of virtual reality in general, so it makes total sense.
Multiple players and viewers can hang out in a “room” and chat, gesture and see reactions of the other players.
Here’s what brand director for Dungeons & Dragons, Nathan Stewart, had to say about the release:
The realness includes familiar character sheets, figurines and terrain tiles so you can build your own maps and adventures.
AltSpaceVR recently raised over $10M and is based in Redwood City.
