Make sure you submit your nomination for the best mobile app of 2015 now! With only one day left until nominations close for the Crunchies Award Show, we want to hear from you.
The Best Mobile app should be a recent standout that has earned its place on your home screen and something that you can’t live without. The past seven winners of this award were imeem (2008), Foursquare (2009), Google Mobile Maps for Android (2010), Evernote (2011), Google Maps (2012), Snapchat (2013) and Storehouse (2014).
Your initial nominations will help TechCrunch editors shape the group of finalists, out of which our Crunchies Board will choose the winning startups. And don’t forget to grab a ticket on our ticketing page.
Tech’s illustrious awards show is February 8th, 2016 at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, and the winners of 12 coveted Crunchies Awards will be unveiled at that time.
