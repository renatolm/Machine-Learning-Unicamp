If you want to relive your classic MS-DOS gaming experiences, you need venture no further than Twitter. The Internet Archive’s website-embeddable games also now work directly in tweets, when you’re viewing them on the web, or in native embeds like the one below. Jordan Mechner’s classic Prince of Persia is a good place to start, if you ask me, but anything in this collection should work just as well.
I was already reeling about the demonstrably cool arrival of classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter games on Steam, but this is next level. Think about it: These games used to sometimes span multiple floppy discs, and now they’re just living inside tweets almost as an afterthought.
Hope you were prepared to fall down a nostalgia hole today.
