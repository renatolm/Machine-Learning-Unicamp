Everyone loves stickers. Snapchat must be on to us because the company just launched Geostickers, a new feature that lets users send city-specific stickers in snaps and messages.
There are 15 stickers available in San Francisco as of now, and we expect more to come. The adorable caricatures delightfully mock tech culture, jab at rising rents and highlight local landmarks. In addition to San Francisco, the feature is also launching in Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, DC, Honolulu, London, Sydney, São Paulo, Paris and Riyadh.
The launch almost seems like an effort to recapture the news cycle from Instagram which launched “Stories,” a Snapchat alternative, earlier this morning. Notably, Stories lacks location filters, stickers and speed effects.
Geo-specific features have been quite a draw for people and businesses. Geofilters, which let users overlay location-specific art onto their snaps, have developed a large community dedicated to producing custom filters. Businesses can even produce Geofilters to advertise for events that are geofenced and enabled for a pre-set time.
Geostickers builds on this community and provides another platform for customizable expression. The addition comes on the heels of Bitmoji integration with Snapchat last month. The app lets people create personalized self-reflective emoji that can be used as stickers in snaps.
