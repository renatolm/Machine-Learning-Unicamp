Drizly, the on-demand booze delivery startup, has today announced the close of a $15 million Series B funding round, led by Polaris Partners, with participation from other existing investors.
Drizly operates in a very similar manner to Uber, providing the technology infrastructure that allows liquor retailers the opportunity to provide their own on-demand service, as well as an e-commerce platform through Drizly Connect.
On the platform, Drizly users can browse a wide variety of beer, wine and spirits, as well as see various delivery windows and prices from Drizly’s retail partners. These partners can then receive orders and place deliveries with their own people, paying Drizly a slice of the transaction.
Through Drizly Connect, launched earlier this summer, both customers and retailers can choose a longer delivery window (up to 48 hours), turning Drizly into its own Amazon Prime of booze.
Founder and CEO Nick Rellas says that around 40 percent of orders that come through the platform are in advance of at least 36 hours.
Drizly currently serves 23 markets, and is on pace to be in 30 (including a couple of markets in Canada) by the end of this year.
Obviously, Drizly isn’t alone in the space. Competitors like Minibar and Thirstie are also proving themselves in the market as consumers become more comfortable shopping for their alcohol online.
With this latest round of financing, Drizly’s total funding comes to $32.8 million.
