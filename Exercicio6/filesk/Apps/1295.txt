Will voice replace our thumbs? Will brands drown out our friends? Are chatbots the future if nobody wants them? TechCrunch Disrupt SF will get the answers from David Marcus, Facebook’s head of Messenger. Get your tickets to see him live on stage Sept 12th to 14th.
Formerly the founder of mobile payments company Zong, Marcus became the president of PayPal after his startup was acquired. He was poached by Facebook in 2014. Since then he’s grown Messenger from 200 million to nearly 1 billion users.
How can other apps grow like that? What’s the secret to running a successful division inside a bigger tech company? What’s it like working with Zuck? On stage at Disrupt we’ll dig into the questions that can help your run your business and prepare for the future of messaging.
Buy your tickets now to save $1,200 before early bird pricing expires. We’ll be back at San Francisco’s Pier 48 for three days of critical insights from tech’s top executives, and our Startup Battlefield competition where you could discover the next big thing.
