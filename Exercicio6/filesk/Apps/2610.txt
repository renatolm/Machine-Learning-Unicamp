Today, Facebook-owned photograph-centric social network Instagram announced that it has hit 400 million users. This comes just nine months after announcing that it hit the 300 million mark.
Looks like they’ll have to update this chart:

Here’s what the team had to say about hitting the 400 million user mark:
Yes, it’s no mistake that the team wanted to let all of us know that it’s growing internationally, the key to grabbing its “next 400M.” It’d be sure nice to know what the splits are on iOS vs. Android, though.
For anyone who was worried that ugly Instagram ads would scare users away in droves, that’s not the case. This is good news for advertisers, who are starting to fill up the network with both photos and video commercials.
Our own Josh Constine pretty much nailed why Instagram continues to blow up when the group announced the 300 million mark last December:
And yup, Instagram sports a bigger user base than Twitter, which last reported 316 million users. Seems like Instagram has cracked the code of finding users in every nook and cranny of the Internet all over the world. With Facebook’s help, of course.
