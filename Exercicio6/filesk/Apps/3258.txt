Today, Yahoo announced that one of their crown jewels, its relationship with NBC Sports, has been renewed.
In a post, Ian Weingarten, SVP, Corporate Development and Partnerships, said:

Itâ€™s hard to argue that one of the few areas where Yahoo still has very active users and interesting relationships is with sports. Sure, the Daily Fantasy stuff might come to an end if the government has its druthers, but this content partnership is key for a company still fighting to find relevance across the internet.
