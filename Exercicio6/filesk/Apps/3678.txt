SeatGeek is already a solid way to score tickets for live events, but now you can use it to sell those tickets, too.
In a sense, the tickets on SeatGeek are being resold already, but the model relied on aggregating tickets that were put up for sale on other sites. With today’s launch of the SeatGeek Marketplace, anyone can make their tickets available through SeatGeek itself.
To sell a ticket, all you need to do is upload your PDF to the SeatGeek site or app, which will then use OCR technology to extract the relevant information. It will even recommend a price for the sale. And once someone makes the purchase, the transfer happens within SeatGeek, and they can just redeem the tickets using their phone.
“We spent a lot of time automating all of the tricky parts of the process,” said Jack Groetzinger (pictured above with his co-founder Russ D’Souza) . “You don’t have to worry about figuring out what the optimal price is. We will, by default, set a recommended price based on our work to maximize the amount of money you can charge.”


SeatGeek is adding support for ticket transfers that don’t come with a price tag. If you want to give a ticket to a friend, or if you have a friend’s ticket and don’t want to just stand around waiting for them, you can just send it to their phone.
The whole process is only supposed to take a few taps. I haven’t sold or shared using SeatGeek, but it was certainly simple to redeem when Groetzinger sent me a ticket. (Sadly, the concert had already passed.)
