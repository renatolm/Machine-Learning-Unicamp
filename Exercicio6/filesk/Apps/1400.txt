Pouring a bucket of ice-cold water over your head, or liking or sharing a charity online might help raise awareness, but what campaigns that go comprehensively viral really need is cold, hard cash. Launched this week, Spotfund has created a site and an iOS app that makes raising $1-$3 donations far easier than before.
The company operates under the idea that if everyone who shares a cause they believe in would also drop a dollar in the cause’s coffers, they’d make a huge impact. Instead of having to give ’till it hurts, the idea is to engage your fans, friends and family to each give a manageable sum.
“Making an impact isn’t about the size of your wallet,” says Spotfund CEO and co-founder Sanford Kunkel. “It’s about the power of your social network.”
The fundraising platform is different in that each of the fundraising efforts are based around stories – and once you’ve made your own donation, you can share it — and encourage your followers to do the same — through the usual suspects in terms of social media platforms.

“Spotfund is changing the perception of what it means to be civic minded,” Michael Marian, COO and co-founder of Spotfund explains, adding that the stories model helps potential donors connect and engage with the causes they believe in.
