YouTube Gaming, Google’s answer to Twitch, is trying to stay ahead of the curve by adding new functionality quickly. One such feature is only available for Android right now, and it’s a “Cardboard Mode” that allows you to watch any video with a theater-type big-screen setting feel.


It’ll feel like you’re sitting and watching a big screen. While the gameplay recording feature only supports 2D recording right now, one could expect that VR with full 360 degree/stereoscopic 3D video will be coming sometime in the future.
Put simply, YouTube and Google aren’t waiting around to see what happens with virtual reality. They’re going to swing for the fences.
