Coffee Meets Bagel, the dating service that focuses on quality over quantity, has today announced the close of a $7.8 million Series A financing round led by existing investor DCM Ventures. Quest Ventures and Azure Capital also participated in the round. 
Coffee Meets Bagel is an impressive little app. 
Launched in 2012, Coffee Meets Bagel aims to find one quality match for their users every day by using friend-of-a-friend connections on Facebook. IF both parties like their match, Coffee Meets Bagel gives the budding couple a discount on a first date activity, like grabbing a coffee or a drink. 
Users have 24 hours to respond to a match before it expires and a new day brings about a new potential love interest. 
Coffee Meets Bagel is different from most dating apps in that it offers some level of accountability. Potential matches are scraped from real-life connections on Facebook, which ensures that everyone is on their best behavior. Plus, one match ever 24 hours means that attention isnâ€™t divided among multiple matches at once. 
The financing will be used to hire more developers and engineers to continue building out the product. 
Earlier this year, Coffee Meets Bagel finally launched an Android version of the app, opening up the service to far more potential users. If you want to check out Coffee Meets Bagel, head over to the website here.
