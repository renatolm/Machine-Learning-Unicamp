It doesn’t happen that often anymore (that’s the real story!), but Twitter.com is down. For the count. As of the time of publishing, it’s been down for about 45 minutes. We’ve checked Twitter’s status page on Tumblr, but there’s nothing there. We’ve also reached out to Twitter for comment and will update you once we hear back.
Twitter’s mobile apps and Tweetdeck seem unaffected, so go ahead and tweet your heads off from your non-desktop non-web browser device setups. Any downtime for a real-time service like Twitter is a disruption, especially because a lot of news breaks on the platform, so this outage is almost like landlines with no dial tones.
Don’t worry. Monday is a pain in the ass for all of us, Twitter.
Let me take this opportunity to once again pine for the days of the fail whale (design, not downtime)…

UPDATE: The desktop version is up and down with some parts of the sites still showing that it’s down. No word as to what happened, but we’ll update if we hear something.
UPDATE 2: It’s back.
