People seem to like editing photos through social media, which comes as no surprise with today’s announcement from Twitter: stickers. Made to be plastered over your new photos, Twitter is making sure that emojis, props, accessories, and anything else of the sort is available to add to that penchant of decorating images you post online.
Twitter’s new stickers are also connected, meaning that if they’re clicked on you’ll be sent to a page of images that use the same sticker(s).

The feature rolls out in the coming weeks for both iOS and Android users, but it’s not the only thing Twitter is working on  — location-based feeds, powered in part by Foursquare are also on their way.
Now, all Twitter has to do is convince me to use the official Android app, and we’ll be set.
