Twitter is expanding its live sports plans, with weekly, live streamed games from Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League.
The live streams will be available for free to out-of-market viewers, whether they’re logged into Twitter or not. Twitter is also announcing a new nightly sports highlights show called The Rally, produced by mobile video company 120 Sports. (The Rally and NHL games will be available in the United States; MLB games will be available worldwide, with exceptions for select international territories.)
Twitter says it will be selling ads to go with this programming, which is enabled by a new partnership between Twitter and MLB Advanced Media.

Earlier this year, Twitter announced a deal with the NFL to stream Thursday Night Football, and it gave users their first peek at its live sports experience by streaming Wimbledon.
