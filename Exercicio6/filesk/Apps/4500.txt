As it promised earlier this year, ToDoist has launched a version of its popular cross-platform task-management software for enterprise users. ToDoist For Business includes the support for collaboration and real-time sync it added back in January, as well as a host of other features.
Despite new features targeted to companies, Todoist For Business’ user interface will look familiar to long-time users. Launching a B2B product makes sense for the company, which has been around since 2007. According to Todoist, 82% of its two million users rely on the to-do list software to manage work-related tasks.
“Given this fact we don’t need to change much in our UX since people are already using Todoist to become more productive at work,” says founder Amir Salihefendic.
With Todoist Business, users can create up to 80 active projects with 200 active tasks and 50 collaborators each.
Other features tailored for companies include an administrator account who can add or remove employees as well as manage payments and invoices; access to a contact list and a team inbox for all users; task management tools with multiple reminders; support for file sharing integrated with Dropbox and Google Drive; and real-time synchronization across 13 platforms, including ToDoist’s Android and iOS apps, as well as its plug-ins for Outlook and Gmail.
ToDoist for Business, which costs $3 per user per month, will compete with a host of other enterprise task management software, including Producteev, Asana, Flow, Trello, and Evernote.
Salihefendic says Todoist For Business’ key differentiators is its cross-platform syncing and integration in popular mail clients, as well as the quality of its mobile apps. He adds that a “few hundred companies (both small and large)” have tested the beta version of Todoist For Business and expects Fortune 500 companies to be a key market for the new software.
