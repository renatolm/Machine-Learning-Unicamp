Dropbox announced a pretty handy feature today that allows you to drag and drop URLs into Dropbox. Anyone with access to where you’ve dropped them can then open the web pages on any device.
It’s basically a bookmark that you can provide as context to something that you’re working on or sharing with someone.
Here’s what the team had to say about it:

When sharing a folder with someone, you now won’t have to jam a URL into the message box or upload a PDF of a web page. Not a huge feature, but definitely a useful one. Mind you, it won’t store or cache any files from the web, it’s just a link to the web page (although there are third-party apps out there that do this). Maybe that’ll come next.
