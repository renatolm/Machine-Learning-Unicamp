Tumblr this morning has begun to roll out a sizable update to its iOS application with the release of Tumblr 4.0. The new application, which also now appears under a revamped app icon, includes a number of features previously available only on desktop, like the ability to create secondary blogs on the fly or submit to submission blogs, for example. Meanwhile, other additions are specifically designed for iOS, like the new “Today” widget.
The widget, which takes advantage of Apple’s iOS 8 feature that allows you to view useful information and other content right on your Today screen, will display what’s trending on Tumblr, rather than activity related to your own blog, or updates from your Tumblr network.
In addition to the features mentioned above, which are focused on allowing you to do more blogging from your iOS device by quickly creating more blogs or participating in blogs that accept posts from others, the updated app also received a few features that had already rolled out to Android. This includes Tumblr users’ most-requested feature: the ability to make video posts simply by copying and pasting in a video URL.
 
Plus, iOS users can now filter searches by post type – like photos, videos or chats – as well as move between the top results and the most recent results. These are features that have been available in the popular third-party Tumblr app for power users XKit for some time, but were sorely lacking in Tumblr for iOS itself.
Also now arriving in the updated app are a handful of more minor improvements, including a sticky search bar, sticky avatars, a better iPad layout, better GIF loading (no seriously, thank you), and more.
The updated Tumblr app began rolling out to iOS users as of 7 AM EST this morning, so if you don’t see it yet, you should shortly.
Update: This post originally noted an “Experiments” section was available under “Settings.” Tumblr explains this is an internal-only build feature.
