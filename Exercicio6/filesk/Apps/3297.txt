If you’re a Vine user then you know that finding new clips can be difficult. I rely mostly on my network to surface really funny Loops, but the team wants to make it easier for you.
Today it has introduced a new channel within the app called “For you.”
Here’s what Vine had to say about it today:

The app will now surface stuff you might like based on what you’re currently watching on the platform, whether you’re following the actual accounts or not. It’s out for iOS now and will be coming to Android soon.
While you’re downloading the update, might I suggest viewing this Vine over and over? You’re welcome:
