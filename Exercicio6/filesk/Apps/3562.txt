Samsung’s entry into consumer virtual reality, the Gear VR consumer edition, seems to be a pretty hot item for the holidays. We reported that both Amazon and Best Buy show that the item is out of stock, sending people to Samsung’s site to order one. You can still order one from Samsung, but you might not get it before 12/25, the site says. Good news is that free shipping has been extended until 12/31.


In other news, the Gear VR just became available in the UK and already shows as sold out, so I’m sure that will have something to do with overall supply.

I’ve asked Samsung about the supply and demand and haven’t gotten a straight answer, but if you’re hell-bent on getting someone special (yourself, maybe?) a Gear VR, you might have to take to eBay and Craigslist to snag one in time. Prices are ranging from $150 to $250, even though the virtual reality accessory costs $99.


People familiar with the product launch have told me that the interest in Gear VR has surpassed their expectations, but Samsung clearly geared up to push it hard…shoving out a pretty well done TV commercial during primetime on the weekends. Overall, the renewed interest in virtual reality is not something anyone will complain about.
Maybe a nice Google Cardboard will be a fair stand-in gift for the time being.
I’ve reached out to Samsung again for comment and we’ll update you if we hear more.
