UCloud, a China-based provider of cloud computing infrastructure and services for games companies, mobile startups and other enterprises has raised $50 million in a Series B round of financing. UCloud, which offers prices that compete against those of Amazon Web Services, says this is the largest-ever funding round for a Chinese provider of cloud-infrastructure-as-a-service. The round was led by Bertelsmann Asia Investments and Legend Capital. Previously, Bertelsmann participated in UCloud’s $10 million Series A along with DCM.
The company says that the funding will go towards building up its R&D and its data center infrastructure — with a special focus on completing facilities in North America and expanding business there.
TechNode reports that the company is eventually eyeing up an IPO in the U.S., riding the recent wave of Chinese tech companies that have listed in the U.S. like JD.com and Weibo, as well as those that plan to list in the very near future — e-commerce giant Alibaba being the biggest of them all.
