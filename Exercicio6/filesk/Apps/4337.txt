Or do we even need one? At Disrupt NY in May, we’ll try to get to the bottom of that question.
In a panel on the new frontier of digital dating, we’ll be bringing together some of the freshest minds in the space to discuss how niche dating services could be the next big thing we swipe right on.
Bumble CEO and founder Whitney Wolfe, Her founder and CEO Robyn Exton, and Coffee Meets Bagel cofounder and COO Dawoon Kang will be joining us on stage at the big show. They will discuss how fragmented the space is, what features work for both their businesses and their users, and how users can develop meaningful relationships on their platforms. (If they even want to.)
Each of these apps brings something different to the dating plate. Bumble lets girls make the first move, Her serves the queer female community, and Coffee Meets Bagel gives you one match only each day. Here’s a little more about each panelist:


Robyn Exton graduated from the University of Bristol with a Bachelors of Science degree. She went on to be a leader at the Geek Girl Meetup in the UK, and then became an Account Manager at Tag, an international design and production agency. Robyn continued her career in design and production at brand consultancy firm Calling Brands, where she went from account manager to biz dev. In 2011, she founded Her (formerly Dattch) as one of the first LGBTQ dating apps for women.

The dating space is changing rapidly and these panelists will be integral in mapping out that journey.
