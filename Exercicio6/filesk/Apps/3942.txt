Gett, the on-demand taxi app looking to take on the likes of Uber, has just announced that it has launched a bid to acquire Radio Taxis in London.
The deal would bring the total number of black cabs available to users to 11,500, which is equivalent to half of all the licensed taxis in the city.
The acquisition is still subject to shareholder approval. However, if it goes through it will make Gett the biggest black cab service in the UK.
Radio Taxis started back in 1953 as an owner-driver cooperative, with a headquarters in the basement of flats in Highpoint in North Hill Highgate, using radios as the primary method of communication. The company has gone through numerous transitions, including becoming a part of Mountview House, which handles a telephone center for dispatch.
In the 90’s, the company switched over to GPS satellite technology, eventually building out an app that works similar to other ride-sharing services, but for licensed black cabs.
As part of the Gett deal, Gett would acquire the other two black cab groups under Mountview House, including Xeta and One Transport.
Here’s what Gett had to say about the potential deal:
Gett’s revenues are projected to reach $500 million globally in 2016, with a focus on enterprise clients.
