Today Instagram has added five new filters for still images, which is the first time they’ve done such a thing in two years. The most recent filters before this, which seems odd considering they’ve been there longer than most of Instagrams users have actually been on the app, were Willow and Mayfair.
Just like you’d expect, each of the new filters has a slightly odd-sounding name (unless you live in SF) which we will inevitably begin using as a verb. (And with a bit of a drumroll…) They are Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden and Perpetua.
“They soften and subtly shift colors to achieve the look and feel you want for your each photo,” says the Instagram blog.
You can take a look at them for yourself below:

Perhaps more importantly than five new opportunities to look totally YOLO (or whatever the kids are saying these days), Instagram is also introducing a way to “Manage” your filters by allowing you to rearrange the ones you use the most at the front of the line and push back the ones almost no one uses like Toaster and Kelvin.
Like so:

The app will also use a preview of your actual photo within the filter icons as opposed to the ultra-familiar hot air balloon preview.
Instagram recently announced that it had hit 300 million users, which beats out Twitter’s most recent numbers.

[Update: Instagram’s parent company Facebook is getting a filter update to just weeks after Twitter and Snapchat made improvements to their photo sharing. Facebook will now auto-enhance the light and shadow of photos you upload so you can post quicker and get back to real life.]
