BBC does radio well, and now Americans can experience the full effect of the UK broadcaster’s audio content expertise with the iPlayer Radio app for iOS and Android. The app contains all of BBC’s radio feeds, including Radio 1 through 6, as well as the World Service. It also has offline support for BBC podcasts, and curated collections of past content.
The app was originally released for iOS back In 2012 (and on Android in 2013), but the native app experience was limited to UK-only listeners. Today marks the first time it’s been available to people in the U.S.
There’s a lot of interest in streamed audio content beyond music among some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Amazon and Google. BBC bringing its existing radio streams to a market that represents the world’s largest english-language listening population makes good sense in terms of staking out territory as interest in spoken programming grows.
