Twitter’s big day is finally here. Tonight is the first night of NFL’s Thursday Night Football, which will be streamed all season on Twitter (as well as CBS and NFL Network as cable partners).
Twitter reportedly beat out companies like Facebook and Amazon for the exclusive mobile stream, and at the time it was a big win for the company under the then new CEO Jack Dorsey. Now it’s time to see if the move will pay off and bring the the platform new users who are coming for the football and not necessarily for Twitter itself.
So how can you actually watch the game tonight? To find the stream you can go to the Moments tab inside the app, or you can go to tnf.twitter.com to access it directly and from the web.
The company also launched an Apple TV, Fire TV and Xbox One app yesterday for users who want to steam the game on their actual TVs. While the game will be available to watch on cable, Twitter would obviously prefer these viewers use their stream, so is launching these apps to make it easier.
The viewing expierence is pretty much what people expected with a video stream at the top of the page, and live timeline of football-themed tweets below. There’s also a place to type in your own tweet which Twitter is automatically ore populating with a #TNF hashtag.
