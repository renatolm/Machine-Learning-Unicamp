Apple is reporting its third-quarter earnings after the bell this afternoon. This will be the first quarter where the company’s new iPhones have been on sale — though only for a few weeks or so. Nevertheless, Apple’s earnings reports are always huge news for the company’s stock, which has basically gone back to where it started at the beginning of the year in recent weeks.
But still, the company has other products than the iPhone that it can talk about — particularly the Apple Watch. The earnings report should come out at around 1:30 PM Pacific, and TechCrunch’s Alex Wilhelm and Matthew Lynley will be dissecting the report and bringing it up-to-the-second information as it comes in.
