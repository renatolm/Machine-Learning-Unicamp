Today, Eminem announced that he’d be investing in and partnering with lyric-annotation site Genius. It’s kind of a match made in heaven, seeing as Eminem’s lyrics are constantly scrutinized.
Here’s what Eminem had to say about the tie-up:
Dollar amounts were not disclosed, but Eminem will keep annotating his own lyrics on the site and Genius will be the “official lyrics engine” for Eminem.com and all of Shady Records’ online properties. Pretty cool.

But now to the real news. Alex and Drew will rap-battle the news before your very eyes. You’ll get to vote after.
Hit play on this sick beat and have a gander:
——————–Alex aka DJ FreshlyFinanced:
Sometimes people don’t get what I’m saying,
But how can I fucking be the best when I’m slaying,
And these fucking haters are confused about the words coming out,
What do you want, to sit and pout, fuck around like a shit lout?
Or you could get your ass to Genius, where shit is tight, live, and hype
Imma sit there and explain my shit to you,
One fucking line at a time,
So if you fuck it up at the show, I know who to fuckin’ shine
and….
Drew aka MC AstroCat:
Yo, Yo, Yo.
You think you got some wicked raps
I keep seeing em on sites that are wicked crap
Imma take my golden words to a place that rocks where I can spread the word
Let people open the pandora’s box of the darkness thats my mind which my mom says is absurd
So if you wanna get the real
You wanna get some shit that Milli Vanilli can’t even steal
Come to Genius for my geniusness
Get in the mirror and watch your face melt for realnesses
——————–
Who wins?
