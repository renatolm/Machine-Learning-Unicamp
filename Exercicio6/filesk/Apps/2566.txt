Tinder, the digital equivalent of making flirty eyes at someone across a bar, is today globally launching the Super Like, the digital equivalent of walking up to someone in a bar and saying “Um, I really like you.”
The company originally launched Super Like as a beta in Australia back in early September, and has since seen those users have 3x the likelihood of finding a match through use of the Super Like.
Moreover, conversations that initiated with a Super Like tend to last an average of 70 percent longer than regular conversations. (Though, to be fair, Tinder won’t disclose the average length of a conversation on the app.)
In case you missed it, Super Like is a new feature on Tinder that lets you get far more explicit than a basic right swipe. Instead of indicating interest anonymously, through a right swipe, and then revealing identities only when there is mutual affection, Super Like lets you tell a certain potential suitor that you’re more-than-just-right-swipe interested.

When you Super Like someone and your profile is then surfaced in their feed, your profile will also have a little badge that shows that you Super Liked them, giving them a bit more of an incentive to check out what all the fuss is about.
Alongside longer conversations and higher match conversion, Tinder cofounder and CEO Sean Rad told TechCrunch that Super Like is seeing a surprising amount of engagement from women in Australia.
Though he wouldn’t get specific about numbers, Rad said that (at least in its Australian beta) Super Like has yielded an uptick in conversions to Tinder Plus, the app’s premium product.
“We’ve seen Super Like have a meaningful impact on Tinder Plus conversion,” said Rad. “And that stems out of the value that people are getting from the Super Like.”
Unpaid users will receive one Super Like per day, and Tinder Plus users can extend that to five Super Likes each day.
