iHeartMedia, maker of the iHeartRadio streaming music app, is launching a new app called iHeartRadio Family.
The app includes music and radio stations selected specifically for kids ages four to eleven, and it was created in partnership with children’s retailer Build-A-Bear Workshop — there will be a Build-A-Bear Workshop Radio station, along with stations like tied to popular artists like Selena Gomez and Nick Jonas, as well as kids’ brands like Disney Junior.
“We know music is already a big part of family life, so we’ve hand selected the music and stations we know kids will love and put it all in one app designed for kids – the new iHeartRadio Family App,” said Chief Product Officer Chris Williams in the launch release.

iHeartMedia describes the new family app as its first “multi-app brand extension” — in other words, it’s the first big launch outside the core iHeartRadio app. Perhaps we’ll see more iHeartRadio apps in the future, targeted at specific audiences or genres.
iHeartRadio Family is free and available for iOS, Android and Amazon devices.
