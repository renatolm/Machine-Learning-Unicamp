We’ve been waiting for an official Star Wars virtual reality experience for some time. With the movie coming out next month, that time is almost now. In an announcement today on StarWars.com, we got some updates on what to expect.
Here’s what they had to say:

You can snag one of the themed Cardboards in a Verizon store on December 2nd — exclusively. There are four different ones, and I’m sure that they’ll become collectible. As does anything physical having to do with Star Wars. Nice score by Verizon. The content will be available on the Star Wars official app for iOS and Android.

The group behind the content itself, Industrial Light & Magic’s ILMxLAB, has been cranking away on creating immersive content for at least six months, so it’s gotta be good.

While you wait, Star-Wars-Up your Google apps.
