Project Fi, which is Google’s way of jumping in the middle of the great carrier race, has shared today that starting tomorrow, you can order a SIM for your data-only device. I’ve switched one of my phones over to Fi and I really haven’t had a problem with finding reception and the way they bill you is refreshing.
Here’s what the Google Fi team said today about the data-only initiative:
If you’re already a Project Fi customer, you can add another SIM for your iPad, Nexus 7 and Nexus 9, or other data-only tablet or device. If you’re not a customer yet, you have to sign up for an invite.

Of course, you’ll want to first confirm whether you’re in Fi’s coverage area.
Subscribers have been getting LEGO sets as a holiday gift, so it’s nice to see that Google is making the customer service for carriers space better. I cringe if I have to get on the line with AT&T.
