Reddit CEO Steve Huffman introduced an updated set of user policies Wednesday, which included details for how Reddit would be “quarantining” certain communities and banning ones which were particular awful, including the infamous r/CoonTown.
Quarantined communities will be hidden from the general Reddit community and only visible to members of those specific subreddits that opt-in. The tactic will be used on communities that are generally offensive and “would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor,” according to Huffman.
The community r/CoonTown and related subreddits were specifically banned today. In the statement Huffman said the bans were exercised on communities that “exist solely to annoy other redditors.”

In a post on r/Announcements, Huffman specified the new policies further:
It’s been a pretty interesting couple of months for Reddit. With a CEO change, tons of backlash from its communities and, on top of that, record traffic, Reddit has seemed to struggle to identify the direction that it wants to head.
Today’s announcement seems to suggest that Huffman is ready to make some changes; we’ll just have to see how they’re implemented and, more unpredictably, how Reddit users respond.
