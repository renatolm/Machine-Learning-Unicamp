Garrett Camp, co-founder of StumbleUpon, says he’ll soon be the site’s majority stakeholder. Again. The site originally launched in 2001.
StumbleUpon was sold to eBay in 2007, but sold back to a group including Camp in 2009. He was active CEO from 2001-2012 and has stayed on as “Chairman” since.
Here’s what Camp had to say about the move, which will include “some difficult changes to the product and company”:
Camp remains CEO of his other company, Expa (which has raised $50 million), while he rejiggers his baby, StumbleUpon. He’s also the co-founder of Uber. Which we hear might have a shot to be huge.
Here he is talking to TechCrunch about buying back StumbleUpon (the first time):
He just can’t quit SU. Not grabbing a second CEO role means he still hasn’t gone full Dorsey. Yet. Never go full Dorsey.
