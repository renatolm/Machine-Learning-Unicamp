Today, Twitter launched an emoji tied to the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, which will air this weekend. Users hash tagging either #VMA of #VMAs will get a very tiny moon man emoji to pop up in their tweet.
Like, seriously, this is how big it is:
Full-sized it looks way cooler though:
We already know Twitter is deep in preparations to revamp how it approaches events with its “project lightning” feature. Over the past few months, the service has also launched a few custom emojis as a fun way of visually unifying conversations about a particular event that’s happening.
For now, the company is just working on its own or with select partners to create custom emojis like this. Twitter has already produced emojis for the Women’s World Cup, UK Election, Ramadan, Copa America in Latin America and the latest Star Wars trailer.
Andrew Fitzgerald from Twitter’s Media Strategy and Operations team talked about the role of emojis in tweets in a Q&A with TechCrunch earlier this month:
Twitter emojis, like Facebook stickers, are super fun to play around with and are really popular, but as a branding method, they just seem a little too small to convey much info, though some designs work better than others.
The VMAs moon man is awesome when viewed full-size, but in tweets it feels like you might need one of these 🔬🔎 to see him planting his flag.
