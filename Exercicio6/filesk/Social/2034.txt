New York-based SocialFlow has raised $7.5 million in Series C funding, the company tells TechCrunch. The startup, which helps media organizations including The Wall Street Journal and BBC optimize their effectiveness on social media, has closed a round led by Gefinor Capital.
A competitor of HootSuite, SocialFlow works with media outlets, including TechCrunch, to ensure that articles get shared on social at the right time. Tweets are automated through SocialFlow’s platform and their algorithm posts Facebook links at a time that will maximize clicks. SocialFlow also has integration with LinkedIn, Instagram and Pinterest. 
Social media has become a critical component for the online media business, with a growing percentage of traffic coming from Facebook and Twitter. CEO Jim Anderson told TechCrunch that SocialFlow can make a significant impact, claiming their platform can bring about “twice the results in terms of clicks and engagement.” The SocialFlow software “takes all that guesswork out of the situation and lets you focus on what you do best.”
With the new capital, SocialFlow expects to improve upon its core business, and will be offering media publications audience insights with demographic data that shows who they are reaching with each tweet. SocialFlow can also help brands optimize their social media advertising by providing recommendations for Promoted Tweets and Promoted Pins.
Other SocialFlow clients include Time Inc., Conde Nast, The New York Times, CBS, NBC, ABC, Mashable and Yahoo.
The latest funding round also includes participation from Cayuga Venture Partners, Fairhaven Capital, Rand Capital and SoftBank. Founded in 2009, SocialFlow has previously raised $27 million in funding from RRE Ventures, SV Angel, Betaworks and others.
AOL Ventures has invested in SocialFlow in the past. AOL/Verizon owns TechCrunch.
