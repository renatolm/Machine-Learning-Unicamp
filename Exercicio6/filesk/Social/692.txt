Twitter announced today that Bret Taylor is joining its board of directors.
Taylor is best-known as one of the founders of social networking startup FriendFeed — and then as the chief technology officer of Facebook, which acquired FriendFeed in 2009. After departing Facebook three years later, he became co-founder and CEO at mobile word processing company Quip.

As alluded to in Kordestani’s statement, Twitter has added a number of new board members since Jack Dorsey returned as CEO last year. (Kordestani himself joined the board last October.) British Internet entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox and Pepsi CFO Hugh Johnston were announced in April, followed by BET CEO Debra Lee in May.
