Two Twitter employees announced their departures right before the company’s second-quarter earnings dropped today. The first, Christian Oestlien, was a VP of Product Management focused on growth. Oestlien came from Google and spent about two years at Twitter.
Its product director, focused on discovery, is also leaving the company:
Todd Jackson spent about a year at Twitter, after his company Cover was acquired.
The Twitter executive makeup sure has changed quite a bit over the past year:
As we know from looking at this quarter’s user growth, or lack thereof, the company has a ways to go to figure out how to grow. Maybe Oestlien and Jackson had had enough and thought it was time to bounce.
Their timing is very curious, to say the least.
