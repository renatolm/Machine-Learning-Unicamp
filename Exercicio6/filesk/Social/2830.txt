If you’re a Twitter on the web user, like I am, then you’ll be happy to know that the company has now introduced web notifications when you get a direct message.
Just keep Twitter open in a tab and click around wherever else you like, the notification will jump out at you anyways on the top right side of the screen.
When you click on the notification, it’ll open up the DM and let you read and reply.
Additionally, the company tells us that it’s making a change to the DM flow on its Android app:

This one is for the folks trying to take public tweets into a DM to talk trash about it. The onboarding for this process is different now, making it more friendly to those who haven’t tried it. Big avatars, recent conversations, etc.
Both of these changes are an attempt to get more conversations going privately to keep people coming back to Twitter and hopefully use its public features, as well.
